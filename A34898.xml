         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The diſeaſe ariſes from the hedge of Diſcipline pulled down, when proud ſlime will acknowledge no Superintendency over it. This Incloſure lay common; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan firſt perſwades to deny Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, then all Baptiſme, then all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; whence, one turnes Leveller, another a Ranter, a third a Quaker, a fourth a ſpirituall Monarchiſt.

Soundneſſe of judgment in profeſſion, reſpects either Doctrine or Diſcipline:
<pb facs="tcp:93936:7"/> Doctrine, which muſt be regulated by thoſe Oracles, delivered by our Saviour and his Apoſtles, as interpreted by the current of primitive Fathers, while (as <hi>Egiſippus</hi> ſaid) the Church was a pure Virgin, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Beſides theſe, the last, and not the leaſt, is ſincerity of heart in practiſe; for, howſoever the World, doting upon guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded miſeries, ſtinking vanities, golden fetters, judges purity of the Spirit but <note place="margin">Ecquid divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae pereuntes, &amp; tranſitoriae facultates, niſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

He knowes him in reſpect of the end, all his thoughts, words, works, are ſo many motions, God is the Centre; his ſpeculations, imaginations, meditations, are ſo many Lines, God is the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference; in God, from God, and for God, is all his good, in whom we live, move, and have our being. But in this he knowes not man, Reaſon is at a ſtand, why God, that ſtood in need of no Creature, ſhould create Man, to delight in him ſo vile a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that Angels, more glorious Creatures than he, ſhould miniſter unto man; that Heaven, with all her Hoſts and Armies, ſhould ſerve man; that Chriſt, that was <gap reason="foreign">

His Phyſick ſerves to ſeek out the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of his ſickneſſe; the brain conceives frenzies, madneſſe, vertigoes in the brain; the Eye ſees three hundred diſeaſes in the ſight of the eye; the Ear can hear of a Parotis, or impoſtumated inflammation in the ear; the tongue can tell of an Angina, or Argur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angina, a Quincie, or ſilver-Quincie in the throat, which ties the tongue-ſtrings: The Hand can feel a Chiragra, or Gout of bribery in the hand, the Sinews are ſenſible of convulſions of worldly cares; the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells of Tympanies, or ſwellings of pride; the Heart of a Cardialgia, or carnall fear; the whole Man of a <hi>noli me tangere,</hi> impatience of admonition.

                  <p>Thus what Man is in his body. The next, what in his Soul: Firſt, What in regard of miſery of loſſes. Secondly, What in regard of miſery of croſſes. In regard of miſery of loſſes, the ſoul of Man hath loſt bleſſings internall, externall, eternall.

                  <p>Secondly, what the Soul of Man is, in regard of the miſery of Croſſes, croſſed with the ſtain of ſin, croſſed with the pain of ſin; the ſtain of ſin, the Mind is ſtuffed with vanity, the Underſtanding is darkened with ignorance, the Will ſtiffned with ſtubborneſſe; hence the Soul is defiled with luſt, polluted with filthineſſe, outraged with paſſions, over carried with affections, pined with envy, overcharged with glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, ſurfetted with drunkenneſſe, boyled with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, tranſported with rage.</p>
                  <p>The pain of ſin conſiſts in conſciouſneſſe, of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Conſcience, and ſenſe of a reprobate ſenſe. This horrour meets a man in the dark, and makes him leap in the night, and makes him quake in his ſleeps, and makes him ſtart in every corner, and makes him think every Buſh a Man, every Man a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, every Devill a meſſenger to fetch him quick to Hell. By this, <hi>Theodorick</hi> ſaw the face of a Man in the mouth of a Fiſh; <hi>Neſſus</hi> heard the noiſe of Murder, in the voice of Birds; <hi>Saunders</hi> run diſtracted over the Iriſh Mountains: This made <hi>Cain</hi> wander, <hi>Saul</hi> ſtab himſelfe, <hi>Judas</hi> hang himſelfe, <hi>Arius</hi> empty his bowells at the Stool, <hi>Latomus</hi> cry deſperately, he was damned, <hi>Julian</hi> confeſſe, that he was conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; makes Man, the Lord of all, ſlave to all: <hi>Lord, what is Man?</hi>

                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:93936:14"/>
                  <p>Thus this Generall, what degenerate Man is in this life; the next, what degenerate Man unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, is in his death: Come to his Bed-ſide, and ſee how darts of calamity dart him.</p>
                  <p>Stiches, aches, cramps, feavours, obſtructions, rheume, flegme, chollick, ſtone, winde, as ſo many tempeſts and whirlwindes, attempt him: View his body ſweating, his members trembling, the head ſhooting, the face waxing pale, the noſe black, the neather jaw-bone hanging down, the eye-ſtrings breaking, the tongue faultring, the breath ſhortning, the throat ratling, at every gaſp, the heart-ſtrings cracking. Thus ſtrugling, in comes Death, Hells Purveyor, to ſummon the Soul to Hell; Reaſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, the Devill endites, Memory gives evidence, Conſcience condemnes, damned Spirits flutter like flies, to catch this Spirit flying. O then, with what ſtentorious cries would it pierce the Clouds, if it had a voyce to cry: Help Eyes, that were as quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted in vanities, as <hi>Lynceus,</hi> and ſee for ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; help Ears, late organs of melody, and hearken for ſome comfort; help tongue, that was my <hi>Suada-Orator,</hi> or <hi>Demoſtenes,</hi> perſwade Satan, affright Death, flatter Hell, and tell my ſoul ſome comfort: Help Feet, that were my wings of ſwiftneſſe, and quickly fetch ſome comfort; help hands, that were my Sword and Buckler, quiet my conſcience, ſtop hells mouth, baniſh Satan, and miniſter me ſome comfort. Alas, the Eyes are cloſed up, the Ears deaf, the Tongue ſpeechleſſe, the Feet lame, the Hands dead, not able to remove the ſlime that ſtops the breath: and Man, that was even now a Body and Soul, is a ſtinking Carcaſe without Soul: <hi>Lord, what is Man?</hi>

                  <p>Thus Death is diſplayed. Next, what degenerate Man is after death: A man of Death, fewell of Hell fire, laſhed with Satyrs, wounded with Scorpions, ſcourged with Furies, ſting'd with Dragons, gnawen with Vipers, ſtill rowling the Stone of ſorrow with <hi>Siſyphus,</hi> turning the reſtleſſe Wheel with <hi>Ixion;</hi> hungring and thirſting, freezing and burning with <hi>Tantalus,</hi> burning with heat, freezing with cold. Romiſh crucifying, Turkiſh ganging, Jewiſh ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Chriſtian racking, burning, firing, fagotting, are nothing to this. And beſides this infinitneſſe, it is everlaſting infinite; the Graſſe of the Field, Sands in the Haven, Stars in the Heaven, may be numbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but the Dayes, and Months, and Years, and Ages, of the torments of <hi>Tophet,</hi> are numberleſſe, which makes the frying Soul cry out, Fountains cool me, Mountains cover me, Rocks hide me, Sea ſwallow me up, that I may be freed from this bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe Sea of miſery. What Adamant can endure this knocking? what Steel this beating? what Braſſe this burning? <hi>Lord, what is Man?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We paſſe from man Degenerate, and come to man Regenerate, the third <hi>what;</hi> what Man is by Regeneration, what in his Redemption, what in his Juſtification, what in his Sanctification? In his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, a Slave bought with a precious Price, a Priſoner reſcued, an Enemy reconciled, a Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour pardoned. Wretched Man was the Priſoner, the Enemy, the Malefactour. Chriſt is the Price, the Reſcuer, the Reconciler, the Pardoner. Woods of Franckincenſe, Floods of Nectar, <hi>Ophir, India,</hi> and <hi>Havilah,</hi> though repleniſhed with Gold and Pearls, could not pay this Price: Angells would
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93936:15"/> have ſunk under the burden, Man could not ſatisfie, God could not ſuffer; therefore Chriſt became both God and Man; God, to ſatisfie, Man to ſuffer: He left his Fathers Throne, for the Virgins Wombe, a heavenly Manſion, for a Manger; a Crown, for a Croſſe, where he was crowned with Thorns, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified between two Theeyes, as a Roſe amongſt Thornes; ſcourged with Whips, faſtned with Nails, pierced with a Spear: where, with Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> view his body ſacrificed for man, his wounds blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for man, his price payed for man, his head ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to kiſſe man, his hands ſtretched out to embrace man; and then ſay, <hi>Lord, what is Man?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, what Regenerate man is by Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, diſrob'd of unrighteouſneſſe, arrayed with Chriſts robes of Righteouſneſſe, cloathed with the Wedding garment, annointed with new Oyle, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the oyle of Grace, burning in his Lamp.

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:93936:16"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, what Regenerate Man is by Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, changed from a vaſſall of wrath, to a veſſell of honour, a ſpirituall creature, purified with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, not with Pelagian purity of conception, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh holy-water ſprinkling, Popes pardoning, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream unction, purgatory ſcorching; not with the Libertines law of Liberty, that hath no Law; but by Grace in the ſoul, that graciouſly clenſes both body and ſoul. The Underſtanding is lightned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt is his light; the Will obedient to God, becauſe he is born of the will of God; the Heart, by ſpirituall comfort, is heartned, and gives over burning; the Conſcience barking; the Pulſe of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour beating; all his Hoſte of Body and Soul, is ſet to ſerve the Lord of Hoſtes: Knees bend to pray, Tongue ſounds to praiſe, Feet run, Hands fight the Lords Battle. Nor is this all, but Man enjoyes him that is all in all, and all in him: <hi>For in Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 22, 23. <hi>all are ours, we Chriſts, and Chriſt Gods.</hi> Satan ceaſe to tempt him, Fleſh to allure him World to beguile him, all is in vain; the Word feeds him, the Spirit guides him, the Creatures ſerve him, the Angells guard him; what joy of the Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, what without, none knowes, no not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Man, but the Spirit of him that made Man: <hi>Lord, what is Man?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus what Man regenerate is in Redemption, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, Sanctification; we come to the laſt <hi>what,</hi> what Man is in his Glorification; what glorified in ſoul till the Reſurrection, what in both body and ſoul to eternity, after the Reſurrection. What Man is glorified in ſoul till the Reſurrection, a glorified ſoul by Chriſts Reſurrection, winged ſwiftly upon
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93936:16"/> the wings of Cherubims to Heaven, where for every Croſſe ſhe receives a Crown; in either Palme, a Palme of Victory; Angells come at her entrance, and ſalute her with an <hi>Euge;</hi> thouſands of Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims, Thrones, Principalities and Powers, ſalute her with an <hi>Euge;</hi> Patriarchs, Prieſts, Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, ſalute her with an <hi>Euge;</hi> Souls of Friends, Parents, Husband, Wife, Children, and all Saints deceaſed before her, ſalute her with an <hi>Euge;</hi> nay, Chriſt himſelfe ſalutes her with an <hi>Euge, Well done, good and faithfull ſervant!</hi> To whom that Soul, with all the Souls, returnes Hallelujah; honour and praiſe to the Antient of daies, that ſits upon the Throne. Now glorified Soul! that wouldſt have won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred with the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> at <hi>Solomon</hi> in his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, at the <hi>Grand Sultan</hi> going to his Seraglio, at the Pope in his Proceſſion; tell me how thou wilt wonder, and glory to ſee that Wonderfull, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eye hath ſeen, nor ear hath heard, nor hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the heart of man. <hi>Lord, what is Man?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus what glorified Man is in Soul, till the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; the laſt, and not the leaſt, what glorified both in Body and Soul for ever, after the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Glorified, in regard of the place of Glory, the object of Glory, the prerogatives of Glory.

The three firſt pointed at the power of the Goſpell; the fourth, at the price; this fifth, at the ſuperlative tranſcendency of the price.

They are fit ſimilitudes, or, if you will, compariſons. That which no mortall eye hath ſeen, (and ſuch is Heaven) muſt be made known by that which hath been ſeen. Princes ſend Pictures, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Paramours. Some things ſublimed above a mortall reach, muſt be read below in Characters proportioned; as the Sun's ſplendour in a Pail, or as <hi>Meduſa</hi>'s head, is fained in <hi>Perſeus</hi> glittering Shield: <hi>Moſes</hi> his face muſt have a Vail, before he can be ſpoke with. Theſe are three-fold; Typicall, as foretelling; Apologicall, as illuſtrating; Methologicall, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing.

Then take up this Optick-glaſſe, <hi>The Kingdome of Heaven is like,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The parts in generall, of this Apologue, are two: Firſt, <gap reason="foreign">

The thing that is likened, <hi>is the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> the thing to which it is likened, is a <hi>Merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> ſeeking goodly Pearles. The Antapodoſis, or reddition to the former part, is not expreſſed, but by collection to be gathered from the latter. As Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chroniſms,

Firſt, a man under ſin, is compared to a Merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Secondly, his ſeeking of ſome good things, (as <hi>omnia appetunt bonum)</hi> to ſeeking of goodly Pearls. Thirdly, the price of glory in Heaven being found, is compared to that one Pearl of great Price, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant found. Fourthly, as the Merchant ſold all that he had to buy that Pearle, ſo muſt we forſake all Earthly things, for this Heavenly Pearle. A Chriſtian then is as a Merchant; probable good things, as Pearls; Heaven is <gap reason="foreign">

Thus then take the Paraphraſe, as a Chart, to direct our Compaſſe in the future diſcourſe. St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> by goodly Pearles, underſtands the godly Precepts of the Law and the Prophets; by that one Pearl of great price, the precious blood of our Saviour, by which we were bought with a price. The Merchant ſold all to purchaſe this Pearl; ſo, with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> we muſt forſake the rites of the Law, <hi>ut Chriſtum lucrifacia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> that we may gain Chriſt. This one Pearl being

                  <p>Again, Goodly Pearles, (ſaies the Gloſſe) is the glory of this World, <hi>deforme conſpicitur,</hi> all is but dung: That one pretious Pearle is that <hi>unum neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> the viſion of the Unity in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, of Grace here by Faith, of Heaven here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after by Fruition. <hi>Omnia vendit negotiator,</hi> the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant ſells all for this <gap reason="foreign">

True Good, is a conformity with the will of God, <hi>archetypa,</hi> not with the will of man. Some are ſimply evill, as ſenſuality, ſinfull pleaſure: Some <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Well then, no wonder, if (as <hi>Varro</hi> ſaith, and the Father of <hi>Hippo</hi> ſecondeth him, in his <hi>Civitate Dei)</hi> there were three hundred opinions in the language of my Text, concerning theſe Pearles. As truth is is one, ſo Errour is infinite; and yet they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Law, the Jewiſh <hi>Targum Cabala,</hi> and <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> which Interpreters compriſe within theſe Pearls. O the endleſſe ſearch of theſe inferiour
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93936:22"/> things! we may ſeek them, but not reſt in them. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is a motion, motion argues imperfection, ſo does Pearles in the plurall number: <hi>Martha</hi> carked for many things, there was but one thing needfull. It is wittily at leaſt obſerved by <hi>Origen,</hi> that God put no <hi>lo, it was good</hi> upon that day, when the light was divided from the darkneſſe; nor muſt we put any reſt in theſe Pearls. For to inſtance in a few: What is Pleaſure, but a pill in Sugar? Beauty, but a painted Snake? Honour, but a blaſt of idle Winde? Riches, but a ſmile of Fortune? and all the Wealth the World hath piled together, but <hi>Obelisks</hi> of vanity? Let ſome Gallants condemn this, as the voice of a melancholick Schollar; yet, I know a day will come, when, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 3. the keepers of their houſe of clay ſhall tremble, thoſe that look out of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes ſhall be darkened, and Death ſhall gnaw upon them like ſheep: then they ſhall confeſſe, that none, nor all theſe, can give their ſouls content.

                  <p>So we are paſſed to the third part or parallel, where obſerve this method: firſt, ſeek; then finde. God anſwers every man to, nay, above his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Saul</hi> ſought Aſſes, and found a Crown; the Mileſian fiſhers, Fiſhes, and found a golden Trivet; the Merchant ſought Pearls of leſſe price, and found one of greater price. This Pearl is but one, and yet <hi>inſtar omnia,</hi> it compriſes all. <hi>Plinie</hi> calls it an Union, and what is it elſe, but an union of God and Man into one perſon? of God and Mankinde into one
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93936:23"/> Covenant? One, becauſe Truth (as the Schoolman ſaith upon this place) is <hi>in diviſa,</hi> undivided, as the Trinity in <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Creed.

                  <p>Well then, get this Philoſophers Stone, and thou needs want no Gold of the Sanctuary; this moſt pretious Pearl, ſo pretious, that it is beyond all conceptions tranſcendant: Reaſon cannot fathom it, but is at a ſtand; Scripture expreſſes, that it is unexpreſſible, <hi>Phil. 4. 7. Eye hath not ſeen, ear hath not heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man.</hi> The Saints at the ſenſe of it, are rapt into an Exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; Cherubims vail their faces: Sanctifying grace in man comes ſomewhat near it, which cauſeth joy in the heart unſpeakable: and yet there is as great a diſproportion, as for a Star that is enlightned by the Sun, to expreſſe the whole glory of the Sun. The World is but a painted Map, the reall Viſion is in Heaven: all Creatures are but Raies and Spangles, from this Pearle that ſits upon the Throne; and keepes the Keyes of Life. Tell me then, poor ſoul, what if this World were as the Gardens of <hi>Alcinous, Elyſian</hi> fields, or Paradiſe; the Rivers run with Nectar, the Fields brought forth Ambroſie, Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinth, and Moly; thy Ways were ſtrowen with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, thy Head crowned with Roſe-buds, each Tree were as the Tree of Life, or Apples of the <hi>Heſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides;</hi> the Heavens were a Globe of Gold, the Earth a Centre of Diamond, the Clouds ſhoured down pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Pearles, like Gold in <hi>Diana</hi>'s lap; each Man were an <hi>Orpheus</hi> or <hi>Amphion,</hi> with Muſicks harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious

The Merchant ſought this Pearl before he found it, and when he had found it, he ſtill went on. A Chriſtian moves in a Circle, that point that ends one motion, like a <hi>Terminus communis,</hi> begins another. Standing water corrupts. Go we muſt for this Pearl, and yet we need not farr; Pilgrimages to the Holy Land, and to the Tombs of Saints, are now out of date; Heaven, in this Sunſhine of the Goſpell, is to be found every where. Go, but not from thine own Paſtour, in every Church. <hi>Revel. 22. 17. The Spirit, and the Bride ſaies, Come: Let him that is athirſt come, and whoſoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</hi> And yet he went, and ſold. That which coſt our Saviour his Blood, muſt coſt us ſomething. Though we have nothing but what we have received, yet, God muſt receive of that which we have: Or if we have any thing, it is but ſin. Let us cut off our Hand of revenge, pluck out our Eye of luſt, belch out our Heart of pride, and ſell our ſelves, that we may buy our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.

                     </gap>, both God and Man, that Man for the glory of God might be zealous. He bought our ſalvation with pangs, and blood, and ſweat, that we, zealous of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and purity, might work out our ſalvation with fear and trembling. He ſweat blood in the Garden, he was beat with cords and whips, fainted under the Croſſe in the way, was faſtned to it with nails, pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with a ſpear, aſſaulted by Satan, Hell, and all our ſins at once, that we might be covered with righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93936:29"/> as with a roab, and cloathed with zeal as a garment. The Turks are zealous of their <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the Sidonians of <hi>Bell</hi> and <hi>Dragon,</hi> the Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> of their Idoll, the Papiſts for their Reliques, Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixes, Images; the Jeſuits of their <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> each Sect of their own ſuperſtitions: Then, ſhal not Chriſtians be zealous for Chriſt, who, zealous of our ſalvation, gave himſelfe for us, that we might be zealous of good works?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſtians muſt be zealous, becauſe zeal is the life and ſoul of Chriſtianity; that which the Bellowes are to the forge, zeal is to the Soul, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindler of grace; that which naturall heat is to the body, zeal is to the ſpirit, a preſerver of Grace; that which Heroicall vertue is to Morall vertues, the ſame is zeal to all divine and heavenly vertues, the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of grace. Zeal is the quinteſſence of Graces di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled, the marrow and life of Religion, the height and hyperbole of Holineſſe. Faith without zeal, is but hiſtoricall, Charity without zeal is but hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, Profeſſion without zeal is but carnall, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence without zeal is but Stoicall Apathie; Mercy without zeal is fooliſh ſympathy, Hope without zeal is but impudency, Love without zeal but lechery, VViſdome without zeal but folly, Martyrdome without zeal but murder. Theſe two reaſons of the Poynt we have but poynted at, becauſe zeal is a Grace that is grounded upon reaſon, yet in the heart, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall; therefore we omit any further reaſon, and come to Application. Firſt, inquiring what true zeal is: Secondly, the ſeverall kindes of zeal.</p>
                  <p>Zeal is defined by the Philoſopher, to be a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of anger and love, when we are angry at the party or thing, that injures that which we love.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93936:29"/> Theſe two affections, as fire and oyle, met together in <hi>Moſes;</hi> he loved God, hated Idolatry, therefore he was angry at that Idoll, that was enmity againſt God. Antient Divines have deſcribed it, to be a mixt affection of griefe and anger flowing from love. Griefe is an affection of the heart, that wounds the ſoul for ſome preſent evill; thus <hi>Jeremie</hi> mournes, for the miſery of the daughter of <hi>Sion.</hi> Anger is mixed of ſadneſſe and a deſire of revenge: <hi>Eſau</hi> was ſad for the loſſe of his Birthright, his heart boyled with revenge againſt his ſupplanting Brother.

                     </gap> neither conſiſts in hatred, nor love, nor ſorrow, nor a deſire of revenge alone, a channell too narrow for zeal to run in, which (like) <hi>Nilus</hi> overflowes the whole ſoul; the higher, the fruitfuller. But true zeal, either conſiſts in a mixture of all the affections, or is a high and heroicall pitch of any affection, that makes Heaven ſuffer violence. A high rapture of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall joy is zeal, that, like St. <hi>Paul,</hi> rapes us up into the third Heaven. The Scheme in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rhetorick was zeal, when he ſaid, <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord alwaies, and again I ſay, Rejoyce.</hi> By this zeal, <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> leapt in his Mothers wombe, at the preſence of <hi>Mary</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving. By this zeal, <hi>Simeon</hi>'s trembling armes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived heat, to embrace our Saviour. By this zeal, the Angels rejoyce in heaven at a ſinners converſion. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it was a high pitch of affection, and no affection but zeal, that lift the ſoul of <hi>Diagoras,</hi> of <hi>Chylon</hi> the Lacedemonian, of the Roman VVidow, off the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; this affection was joy. And, as a high pitch of joy, ſo, ſtrain the pegg of ſorrow, and it will prove zeal. Joy, a rapture for the preſent good; ſorrow a

Jeremiah</hi>'s mourning for the captivity of the people, <hi>Come and ſee, if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow,</hi> may make up the tale of zeal. <hi>David</hi>'s mourning <hi>all the day long, watering of his couch. Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>'s <hi>chattering as a ſwallow, or crane in the deſert,</hi> is the fruit of zeal. Hope, when it is wafted with full ſailes towards the Haven, and like the Heliotrophium ſpreads it ſelfe towards the Sun of righteouſneſſe, is zeal.

And as hope, ſo fear, when it is a Graduate in the Univerſity of the Soul, puts on the habit of zeal; this fear muſt be filiall: Such zeal as this was the fear of Martyrs, which feared God more then thouſand deaths and burnings.

                  <p>In the ſecond place, we come to diſtinguiſh the ſeverall kindes of zeal, or by the touchſtone of tryall, to difference true from falſe. All zeal is a fire, and then true, when like <hi>Eliah</hi>'s fire, it is from Heaven; then falſe, when like <hi>Nadab</hi>'s and <hi>Abihu</hi>'s, it is ſtrange fire, ſuch as God commands not. Falſe zeal may be fixed, either upon the true or falſe object, true zeal onely upon the right object. When zeal is ſet upon the falſe object, it may be great, ſetting Churches and Commonweales in combuſtion, but can never be good. This wildfire is either Doctrinall in opinion, or Practicall in converſation; Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, ſo the Turks are zealous for their <hi>Mahometan</hi> ſuperſtition, and <hi>Alcaron,</hi> the Epheſians for their Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> and ſilver Shrines; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for their Popes Supremacy, Images, Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the <hi>Browniſts</hi> againſt the buildings of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which they call Antichriſtian Synagogues. Practicall in converſation, when our zeal towards riches, makes Mammom our God, and things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that ſhould be our Perſpective-glaſſe, to look
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93936:31"/> towards Heaven, proves our Looking-glaſſe; when ſuch is our zeal in Prayer, that though we ſeem to petition firſt for ſpirituall things, after for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, our affections reads them backwards, like fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, valuing the latter ten times more than the former. Again, zeal may be falſe, when it is fixed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon the right object, and that either in regard of the meaſure, or means. In regard of the meaſure, either too cold, which is remiſſion, or too hot, which is ſuperſtition; too cold, and this is the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of carnall worldlings, time-ſerving polititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, formall profeſſours, that will ſeem to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and yet will give no ſheafe of their corn, no penny of their talent, no oyle of their cruſe, to the poor members of Chriſt; Chriſtians in name, yet Devills incarnate indeed, zealous for the ſmoak of their chimney's, the watercourſe of their channells, the duſt of their waies, the bubble of their fame; yet, without any touch of conſcience, hear the name of God blaſphemed, ſee his Church profaned, ruinated; ſee the Fatherleſſe wronged, the Widow oppreſſed; ſee the bleeding wounds of both Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth gaping.</p>
                  <p>Zeal upon the right object too hot, which is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition; this zeale is either of them, which are too hot for Ceremonies, that they advance them into the chair of Subſtance, puniſh the neglect of them as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, as blaſphemy, as murther, as theft: Too hot againſt Ceremonies, that while they brand others with ſuperſtition, ſurmount the higheſt Tower of ſuperſtition, forſaking holy ſolemnities for a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, the Sacrament for a geſture, the Miniſtry for things of the leaſt moment; pay Tithe of Anniſe, Mint, and Cummine, let paſſe the wonderfull things
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93936:31"/> of God; ſtrain at a Gnat, and ſwallow a Camell. Falſe zeal, yet fixed upon the right object, in regard of the means and ground upon which it is builded; builded either upon ignorance, our own ends, or other men: Ignorance of them, that are hot in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, a ſpur to others, a cenſurer of all men, that are ſlacker then they in duties that ought to be done; yet, they know no ground in Scripture, no reaſon in Nature why. This is falſe zeal, the zeal of ignorant Romiſts, to believe as the Church believes. Zeal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the right object, for our own ends; thus <hi>Judas</hi> was zealous for the bag, the People in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for the Bread, the Prieſts of <hi>Bell</hi> for the Wheat and Oyle, thoſe in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time, that went with the Chriſtians to the Aſſembly of Prayer, becauſe they were commonly attended with Love-feaſts. This is falſe zeal, becauſe it is not a heat of the heart, but of the ſtomack, and may be ſo ſincere, as to ariſe out of the bowells, yet it ends in the belly. Falſe zeal upon the right object, when it is builded upon men; zealous of the Word, when it is preached by ſuch a man; key-cold, when more learnedly, more powerfully, more ſincerely by another: They pray after ſuch a manner, becauſe ſuch an one, who is their <hi>Paul,</hi> their <hi>Apollos,</hi> their <hi>Cephas,,</hi> their Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god, does ſo: Run ſo many miles to hear a Sermon, leaving a better at home behinde them, becauſe ſuch an one makes conſcience of ſuch things, conſcience to diſobey the Ordinance of God, conſcience to be ſingular, conſcience at the beſt, to be zealous not according unto knowledge, which is as good a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as a painted man is a man. Now we come to true zeal, true in regard of the Object, Gods glory, Righteouſneſſe, Heaven, and ſpirituall things; true
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93936:32"/> in regard of the meaſure and degree, neither too cold by remiſſion, nor too hot by ſuperſtition. True in regard of the means and grounds, not builded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ignorance, which is blinde zeal; nor upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or pleaſure, which is counterfeit zeal; nor upon men, our Idoll-gods, which is idolatrous zeal. Of this here more briefly, becauſe we ſtood more largely upon falſe zeal. For, as <hi>rectum curvi,</hi> ſo <hi>curvum &amp; ſui, &amp; recti index;</hi> in the glaſſe of falſe zeal, we may judge of true zeal.</p>
                  <p>But, that we may diſtinguiſh this true fire of zeal, from many wildfires; true heat, from feavouriſh heat; <hi>Amphitryo</hi> from <hi>Jupiter, Juno</hi> from the Cloud, <hi>Salam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nder</hi>-like, let us abide a while in theſe flames. For, what is true of conſcience, may be ſaid of zeal; each man, each Heretick, pretends a zeal; the Turks die for their <hi>Mahomet,</hi> it is their zeal; the Jeſuits ſtab Kings, dethrone Princes, it's their zeal; the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians go to the Stake, for denying the Divinity of Chriſt, it's their zeal; the Iſraelites offer their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to <hi>Molah,</hi> it's their zeal; thou leaves divine Ordinances, the Sacraments, perhaps thy weighty Calling, it's thy zeal. Well, but all that ſay they are <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> are not of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Therefore if thou wouldeſt have the touchſtone of tryall, obſerve theſe marks well, and thou maiſt diſcern true zeal by them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the matter and ſubject of thy zeal muſt be good, <hi>Gal. 4. 18. It is good to be zealouſly affected in a good matter.</hi> This is a fire that burnes in no Lamp, but the Lamp of the Sanctuary; a fire that feeds upon no oyle, but the oyle of the Sanctuary; that is kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled upon no Altar, but Gods, devoures no Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice but Gods. If the matter and ſubject of thy zeal
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93936:32"/> be evill, thy zeal is evill. No fire but <hi>ignis erraticus,</hi> will feed upon ſtinking ditches; no fire but <hi>ignis lambens,</hi> will feed upon thine own carnall humours. If thou be zealous with <hi>Saul</hi> againſt Chriſtianity, it is blaſphemy; if thou be zealous with the Phariſees, to compaſſe Sea and Land to make a Proſelyte of thy groundleſſe opinions, it is diabolicall Hereſie. Thy zeal is a fruit, that muſt not grow upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden tree. Though thine eyes be now blinded, yet hereafter they may be opened, that thou maiſt ſee the blindneſſe of thy zeal.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, true zeal, is zeal according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 2. this knowledge muſt be the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures truly underſtood, guiding us as a pillar of fire by night, a pillar of cloud by day. No fire might kindle the Veſtalls Lamps, but from the Sun; no fire will kindle this Lamp of zeal, but the Sun of Righteouſneſſe, Chriſt; who (as <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſaies) as he was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the eſſentiall Word, by which all knowledge was created, ſo he is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Word of life, which is a <hi>light unto our feet, and a lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn unto our ſteps.</hi> For this cauſe, <hi>Bernard</hi> compared knowledge and zeal to two wings; knowledge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out zeal, cannot flie ſo high as to pierce the clouds; zeal without knowledge, is beatt back again like a whirlewinde: Take with thee both wings, Zeal and Knowledge, if thou wouldeſt flie to Heaven. As is fire to a Child that walks among barrells of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, ſo is zeal without knowledge, a cauſe of incendiaries and combuſtions in Common-weales. This zeal without knowledge, ſlaſhed and gaſhed the Prieſts of <hi>Baal;</hi> this zeal without knowledge, armes the ignorant Papiſts, to maintain that with ſword and blood, and perſecution, which they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93936:33"/> with the Word: This zeal without knowledge, makes many ignorant people in our nation, (as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterouſly, as if one ſhould ring the Bells back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at the ſparkling of a Smith's Forge, or fire the Beacons at the diſcovery of a poor Dunkirkers Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell) to be up in armes againſt every thing, that croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes their humours.</p>
                  <p>This blinde zeal works three dangerous effects in the ſoul; 1. Pride. 2. Uncharitableneſſe. 3. Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of admonition. Firſt, Pride, that like Lucifer the morning Star, they are bright in their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, like the Element of fire over all Elements; nay, as good as in Heaven in their own conceit, caſt in the ſame mould with <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi>'s Image, their head is of Gold, but their feet of Clay. Secondly, this zeal without knowledge is Uncharitable, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring, nay, condemning all, like the fire of <hi>Eliah,</hi> not ſparing the Elders. This made the Jewes crucifie Chriſt, for reproving their traditions; the Arrians perſecute the Orthodox Chriſtians, more then did the Heathen Emperours; the Papiſts more zealous for their Canons of the Councill of <hi>Trent,</hi> than for the Articles of their Creed. Thirdly, zeal without knowledge is impatient of admonition; it is as deafe as an Adder, though you charm it never ſo wiſely; be earneſt, and it flies with the ſting in your face. This zeal made the Phariſees impatient, when our Saviour rebuked them for their blindneſſe; made <hi>Zedekiah</hi> impatient of <hi>Michaiah</hi>'s admonition. And for theſe cauſes, a worthy Divine ſaies, Zeal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge is more dangerous in Church or Commonwealth, then knowledge without zeal.</p>
                  <p>The third mark of true zeal is, that it burnes fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently within the Furnace of the Heart, before the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93936:33"/> flame burſt out at the creviſes of the body; thy Soul and Conſcience muſt be truly zealous within, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thine eyes ſparkle with zeal to affright others, thy tongue be tipped with zeal, to cenſure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke others, thy feet be ſhod with zeal to purſue others, thy hands be armed with zeal to wound others. Many Zealiſts now adaies, are like the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then God <hi>Momus,</hi> carp at all, doe nothing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; like the Flies ingendred from the wild Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, provoke others to ripen, but are barren them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; finde fault with every corner in the ſtreets, never ſweep before their own doors; are informers, controulers in every Calling, practiſes none them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and, as if they were Metropolitans of the whole VVorld, they keep continuall viſitations and corrections of all mens manners, eſpecially the Churches, who (if judged by true zeal) ſcarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Church. Zeal hath many more marks, which if I ſhould proſecute, my zeal of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject would ſeem to outrun my diſcretion of the Time. I'le onely name them.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Mark is, that we muſt be zealous in weighty matters. The fifth, that we muſt look as well to our purity within, as our holineſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. The ſixt, that we muſt be as ſtrict to our ſelves, as to others. The ſeventh, that we condemn ſin as well in friends, as foes. The eighth, that it oppoſe it ſelfe againſt the ſins of the Mighty. The ninth, that it be joyned with compaſſion. The tenth, that it be deſirous of admonition. The eleventh, that it be fervent in Gods Cauſe. The twelfth, that it be conſtant in all eſtates. Theſe are the twelve Signes of zeal, through which Chriſt Jeſus, the Sun of righteouſneſſe, moves in the Zodiack of our ſouls.</p>

Man, when he was free, and ought nothing, but ſervice to his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne, ſold himſelfe for nothing (and was not this a miſery?) but for an Apple. Even ſmall things,

VVe count that Prince unwiſe, that exchanged his golden Armour for braſen; an Indian, that will give a Pearl for a Glaſſe, a pretious Jewell for a <hi>Chiua</hi>'s diſh: Yet, we ſold Earth, Heaven, our ſelves, God, Grace, and Glory, for the price of Vanity, and ſtood in need to be bought with a price our ſelves, for we were not our own. Not our own, for God had forſaken us, the Fleſh had inveigled us, Satan ſupplanted us, the VVorld impriſoned us, Hell threatned us, Death tyrannized over us. Thus were we loſt, and ſtood in need of a price. Loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> his firſt ſin was ours by imputation; loſt by inborn corruption, traduced by propagation; loſt again daily by actuall conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. <hi>Eve</hi> had but one Tempter in Paradiſe, we three here, (as the three goddeſſes did <hi>Paris)</hi> each promiſes fair; the Fleſh Beauty, but paies with <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciam vos,</hi> I will infect you: The VVorld Riches, but paies with <hi>deficiam vos,</hi> I will fail you: Satan Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but paies with <hi>interficiam vos,</hi> I will ſlay you.

                  <p>And becauſe loſt, let us therefore finde our hearts, and be humbled for our loſſe, if we deſire to finde again. The Prodigall at firſt loſt his Eſtate, and at once found his Father and himſelfe: If he had not loſt himſelfe on Earth, he had ſcarce found Heaven; when he went aſtray he was humbled, and no ſooner humbled but he was advanced.

                  <p>This is the outſide of his ſufferings, and was he free within? theſe were but love-tricks to what his Soul endured. <hi>O all ye that paſſe by the way, behold and ſee, if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow.</hi> Alaſſe! what can we ſee of thy ſorrowes? we can no more ſee thy pain, than endure it; only this we ſee, that what the infinite ſins almoſt of infinite men, committed againſt an infinite Majeſty, deſerved in infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of time; all this Thou, in the ſhort time of thy Paſſion, haſt payed for to the full, and <hi>we are bought with a price.</hi>

                  <p>O dear Chriſtians, how ought theſe Earthy, Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky, Adamantine hearts of ours, rent in pieces at this Meditation? What, all theſe tears, and pangs, and groans are for us, yea, from us. Shall the Son of God thus ſmart for our ſins? yea, with our ſins, and ſhall not
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93936:38"/> we grieve for our own? How far were our ſoules gone, that could not be ranſomed with an eaſier price? If thy Soul had been in His Souls ſtead, what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of it? it ſhall be, if His were not in ſtead of thine. Go too now, thou lewd Man, that makes thy ſelfe merry with uncleanneſſe, thou little knowes the price of one ſin, which made thy bleſſed Saviour cry out, to the amazement of Angells, and horrour of men, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> But now, <hi>we are bought with a price.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if we be bought with a price, then away with thoſe Jubile Proclamations of <hi>Rome,</hi> I mean the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogatory ſufferings of Saints, to pay forth this price; a blaſphemous and beggerly Principle, (as lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Fulk</hi> calls it). Some modeſt Doctours of <hi>Lovain</hi> would have minced it, affirming, that the ſuffering of Saints are not truly ſatisfactory, but only motives to move God, to apply unto us Chriſts ſufferingss: but they were ſoon charmed by four ſeverall Popes, (as their own Cardinall confeſſes) and commanded to ſpeak home with <hi>Bellarmine, Paſſionibus Sanctorum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piari delicta,</hi> that by the ſufferings of Saints, our ſins are expiated, and that by them applyed, we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from thoſe puniſhments, we yet owe to God. Blaſphemy worthy of tearing of garments!</p>
                  <p>How hath Chriſt payed the price, if we muſt ſupply the defect? But, <hi>we are bought with a price.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take up then a Song of deliverance, far more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious than that of <hi>Moſes, Deborah,</hi> or <hi>Gideon.</hi> Art thou afraid of Satan?

                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:93936:39"/> Nay this price hath payed for the aboliſhment of the Ceremonies of the Law. Away then with New Moones, Sacrifices, and the rites of <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> the vail of the Temple is rent. That conceit of <hi>Theophylact</hi> is witty at leaſt, That as the Jewes were wont to rend their garments, when they heard blaſphemy; ſo the Temple not enduring thoſe execrable blaſphemies againſt the Son of God, tore her Vail apieces. But that is not all. The vail rent, is, the obſervation of the Rituall Law cancelled.

                  <p>All things ought to begin for, to terminate in, Gods glory, which is the end of all our actions, the centre of all our motions.

And thus, what one ought to have done, a three-fold cord muſt move us to do, to glorifie God. We are Gods, both in body and ſpirit; Gods, becauſe we are redeemed both in body and ſpirit by the Son of God. This is the main and cardinall reaſon, let us proſecute it.</p>
                  <p>What mercy was ever like this? for a God to ſell his own Son, that he might redeem his Enemies? What more dear than a Son, what more hatefull than an Enemy? Yet, oftentimes we ſee, that the hate of an Enemy, is drunk up of the love of a Son. <hi>O my ſon Abſalom, would God I had dyed for thee. Fulvius,</hi> a Roman Senatour, ſlew his Son, for conſpiring with <hi>Cateline;</hi> but, in Chriſt was no guile found. <hi>Manlius</hi> adjudged his Son to die, for violating the Law of Armes; Chriſt kept the whole Law. <hi>Aegeus</hi> ſent his ſon <hi>Theſeus,</hi> to conflict with a <hi>Minotaur,</hi> to free himſelfe and his Country from deſerved bondage; God ſent his Son to conflict with Satan, Death, and Hell, who was <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>O curva in terris animae!</hi> O fond ſouls, like the poor lunatick man at <hi>Athens,</hi> to preſume upon that which is Gods prerogative. <hi>Vermis craſtinò moriturus,</hi> a worm, that muſt die to morrow. Before God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Man a Beeing by Creation, he gave every thing for the Well-beeing of Man, by his everlaſting pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, Predeſtination, Election: Purpoſe, to make Man in his own Image, to make ſo many in number of men, (though not all their ſouls at once, as <hi>Origen</hi> ſaid) as there are Angells fallen; ſo many, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells that remain in purity, ſay ſome; ſo many as the Angells pure and impure, ſay others; how many, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, and that's the truth moſt certain. By Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, in which gift or chain of Gods mercies are three links: Firſt, the decreeing of man to a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall end. Secondly, the gift of eternall life, which is the ſupernaturall end. Thirdly, the diſpoſing of all ſaving means, to this ſupernaturall end, all ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in time, yet ordained before all time. By Election, which is a culling and picking of ſome out of the maſſe of ſin, leaving others in the maſſe of corruption: As a Jeweller purifies what Gold, a man ſifts what Wheat he pleaſes; ſo God purifies the Elect his Gold, ſifts the Saints his Wheat for his Granarie, paſſes by the reſt for their ſin, I will not determine whether Originall or actuall ſin, nor deny them Chriſt in ſome ſenſe, whom the <hi>Father ſpared not, but delivered up for all.</hi> The reaſon why Chriſt was not effectuall for all, was their infidelity and ſin. It is true, (as the School-men ſay) <hi>Predeſtinatio nihil ponit in praedeſtinato:</hi> Predeſtination is an act of meer mercy in God, not of merit in man; neither in regard of the Decree, which was, when he was nothing; of the firſt infuſion of Grace, when he was worſe than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93936:43"/> in which God was the ſole Agent, man the Patient; yet, man is an Agent, and operative in uſing of grace, which he was a Patient in receiving of. Whether God gives this grace to all indifferently, I will not here queſtion: But to the purpoſe, to whom he gives this grace in Chriſt, he will give all. And as God was a giver in intention, before he made any thing, ſo he was a bountifull giver in execution, after he had made all things: By Creation, by Preſervation, to ſuſtain the body; by Vocation, Juſtification, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, to adorn the ſoul here; by Glorification to crown both body and ſoul hereafter. By Creation, making that of nothing, which was neereſt nothing, the firſt matter of all, (as the Philoſophers calls it) <hi>Moſes, Tohu vebohu;</hi> the <hi>Septuagints,</hi>

All made by God, all gifts given by him: And as given by Creation, ſo continued by Preſervation, garding of us by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate providence, by Angells, by Secondary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. By immediate Providence; For as <hi>omnia fecit, ſic omnia fulcit,</hi> that hand that made all things, ſupported all things; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And as he gards us with his Providence, ſo with his Angels; whether with a good Angel to ſupport us, as a bad to tempt us; whether every man have one ordinarily deputed,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93936:44"/> whether from his Birth, or from his Baptiſme, (curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpeculations, more befitting the Schooles than the Pulpit) I'le not diſpute. My preſent Theme is to prove, that it is God that gives; that He, in my Text, that gave his Angells charge over his Son, hath given his Angells charge over all, for whom he hath given his Son, and he hath given his Son for us all, that they ſhould take us up in their armes, leſt we daſh our feet againſt ſtones. And ſhall not He, that gave his Angels as miniſters, his Cherubims as flames of fire, give us an inheritance with the Angells, and free us from eternall fire. To his immediate Providence, as he hath ſubſtituted the Angells, ſo all Secondary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; the Heavens with motion, light, influence; the Fire to refreſh, the Aire to cheriſh, the Earth and Sea to nouriſh, Food to feed, Phyſick to cure, Cloaths to cover theſe our bodies: All theſe he gives us, (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaies) <hi>non propter defectum ſuae virtutis, ſed propter abundantiam ſuae bonitatis;</hi> not that his power fails, but that his mercy overflowes. For, he could feed us without food, cure us without phyſick, ſave us from cold without covering. Neither is he only the giver of temporall things for the body, but ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall for the ſoul; by Vocation, either externall, the Word preached, <hi>Aaron</hi>'s golden Bells ringing, the Sacraments, as nails of the Sanctuary; or internall, the Law by the Spirit hammering, the Goſpell ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Grace ſeaſoning our Souls. By Juſtification, in forgiving our ſins, and imputing to us the merits of his Son. By Sanctification, as the Gold by filing, ſo our Souls by purifying, are made clean. The Sun enlightens the dark Moon, the Sun of Righteouſneſſe enlightens by his Spirit our dead members. By Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, <hi>non noſtra merita, ſed ſua dona coronans,</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:93936:44"/> crowning not our merits, but his own mercies. Theſe we touch briefly, becauſe in giving his Son, he gave theſe, <gap reason="foreign">

And if God be the giver of all, (as Rivers receiving their Springs from the Sea, return them to the Sea) let all things give praiſe to the God of gods, to the Lord of lords, for his mercy endureth for ever. Mountains and Hills, Fountains and Springs, all Tongues, and Tribes and Kindreds, praiſe the God of mercies, as long as his mercy endureth, and his mercy endureth for ever.

A right to all things, not a poſſeſſion of all things: Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> had a right to <hi>Canaan,</hi> becauſe God had promiſed it, though he poſſeſſed it not; God, if it were for their good, would give them the fruition of all things. An Orphant truſts his Guardian for his means, a Patient his Phyſitian for his dyet; and dare not thou truſt God? While thou art Militant here, thou art under tuition, and ſhalt not poſſeſſe all till

So does God, the wiſe Phyſician of our Souls, give us all things that we need, but not all things that we luſt.</p>

And here me-thinks I ſee the noble Army of Martyrs, that ſeemed to the World to have nothing, to throw down the Gantlet of defiance, and triumph, that in Chriſt they have all things, Armour of proof, a ſtrong Tower, an invincible Fort, a Rock of ſalvation, that if Men, Devills, Leviathans, Behemoths, loſſes, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, torments, ſwarm about them like the Flies of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> this <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93936:52"/> of deliverance, for that miraculous diſcomfiture of <hi>Senacherib</hi>'s army, in the daies of <hi>Hezekiah?</hi> But we leave that as more then probable, &amp; come to the parts of the Pſalm, which are four: The firſt is a Preface, in the two firſt verſes, laying down the Argument, that God is to be praiſed, enforced by two reaſons; the one drawn from his wonderfull works, whereby he hath ſhewed himſelfe to the Jewes; the other, from his ſpeciall preſence at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and hiding his face from the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The ſecond containes a deſcription, of that great victory Gods mighty arme had given them over their enemies. The third, propounds the Doctrines drawn from thence, for the Churches edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, from the ſeventh to the tenth verſe. The fourth and laſt, is an <hi>Epiphonema</hi> or concluſion, in the two laſt verſes, exhorting all Tribes, and Tongues, and Kindreds, for the foregoing motives, to praiſe and glorifie God. Thus the Analyſis.</p>
                  <p>The Text belongs to the third branch, containing points of Doctrine, for the Churches inſtruction: For having expreſſed, that God had broke the enemies bow and arrowes, ſhield and ſword, in battle; that he had ſpoiled the ſtout-hearted; that at his rebuke, the horſes and chariots were caſt into a dead ſleep: The Spirit of God enforces this concluſion, in the beginning of the ſeventh verſe, <hi>Thou, even thou art to be feared.</hi> The Emphaſis in the word <hi>[Thou]</hi> redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, implies as much, as if he had ſaid, Not princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities, not powers, not hell, not death, nor any thing for themſelves, but thou O Lord alone art to be feared. Arguments and reaſons to confirm it are two, here laid down in the Text: The firſt is drawn from Gods anger, who hath decreed, and accordingly executes, vengeance upon all proud rebells. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93936:53"/> is drawn from his power, not Princes, not Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, not Men, not Angells, are able to endure the breath of his fury: For, <hi>Who may ſtand in thy ſight, when once thou art angry?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words at the firſt view, ſeem to divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into theſe two parts: Firſt, an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or queſtion, <hi>Who may ſtand in thy ſight?</hi> Secondly, an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or ſuppoſition, <hi>When once thou art angry.</hi> But if by more ſtrict examination, we lay them up on the file, the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or Suppoſition (as in all neceſſary truths) may be reſolved into an infallible Poſition; as if he had ſaid, There is a time, when God will be angry. The <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or Queſtion, is equivalent to a negative Propoſition, but with more Emphaſis and ſignificacie, as if he had ſaid, None can ſtand in thy ſight. Hence theſe two points of Doctrine, naturally ariſing, offer themſelves to our conſideration: Firſt, If men continue in ſin, there will be a time when God will be angry. Secondly, When God is angry, none can ſtand in his ſight and abide it. And of theſe in order. But firſt, the words are to be unfolded, for the clearer underſtanding of the matter; in which, if there be any difficulty, it is in theſe two; firſt, what it is to ſtand in Gods ſight; ſecondly, in what ſenſe he is ſaid to be angry. Standing is properly a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the body, that argues ſtrength, valour, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe; for while Souldiers ſtand in their ſquadrons and ranks, there is hope they make at their Enemies, and reward them; if not, they either turn their backs, and are diſcouraged, or fall to the ground, and ſo are utterly diſcomfited. So here in the Text, <hi>Who may ſtand?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, O Lord, if thou ſhouldſt bend thy bow, and whet thy glittering ſword to come to Battle, what man, what Angell would not
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93936:53"/> fall before thee, and melt as wax before the fire? Thus much for the former. The ſecond is, to inform our judgments, how God can be angry? The truth is, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is a ſpeech borrowed from men, in whom anger ſometimes ſignifies diſpleaſure or diſcontent, <hi>Gen. 45. 5. Be not angry at your ſelves, that you have ſold me hither;</hi> that is, be not diſpleaſed. Sometimes it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a deſire of revenge, upon the perſon of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, <hi>Matth. 5. 22. He that is angry with his brother without a cauſe, ſhall be in danger of judgment.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it ſignifies diſpleaſure, not againſt the perſon, but againſt the ſin of our neighbour, or our own ſin; this kinde of anger, if it be moderate, and joyned with compaſſion, is a holy affection, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 1. In that ye were godlily ſorry, what [anger] hath it wrought?</hi> that is, holy indignation againſt ſin. Anger, in the firſt ſenſe, is not a diſcontent in God, for he is all fulneſſe of joy, and nothing can hinder his Bliſſe; it cannot be a diſpleaſure at any mans perſon without a cauſe, for God is angry at none, but thoſe that firſt have diſpleaſed him. Thirdly, it is not a paſſion or pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation in God. But the truth is, he is ſaid to be angry, when he does ſuch things as angry men do, who pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and take away ſignes of favour from ſuch, as they be angry withall. This the word <hi>[anger]</hi> in the originall imports, comming from <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>aph,</hi> that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a noſtrill, becauſe anger ſhowes it ſelfe in ſnuffing and breathing of the noſe; therefore <hi>David</hi> deſcribing God when he is angry, ſaies, <hi>Pſal. 18. 8. There went a ſmoke out of his noſtrills, and fire out of his mouth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, coles were kindled by it.</hi> Not that God hath paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or mouth, or breath, or noſtrills; but becauſe that men, when they are an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>; It is ſpoke in the dialect of men, but muſt be underſtood in an Idiom proper to God. Of this more fully, when we come to the Uſes: thus much for opening the words. Now to the firſt point of Doctrine, which is this, Though the enemies of the Church ſhould link themſelves together in bands of Iron, yet a day will come, when God will be angry.</p>
                  <p>For the proof of this, ſee what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies; he does not ſay, Becauſe God is mercifull, therefore they may take their ſcope in ſinning; becauſe he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes not preſently, therefore he ſees not; becauſe he is long-ſuffering, therefore his juſtice ſhall not be executed: But he evinces the contrary, <hi>Rom. 2. 5. But after thy hardneſſe and impenitent heart, thou trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureſt up to thy ſelfe wrath againſt the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.</hi> As though he ſhould ſay, Do not think to eſcape, becauſe thou enjoyes hearts eaſe, Halcyon daies, and daies of peace; for every ſin God hoords up, and ſeales as in a bag; the devill truſſes up, as in a bill of inditement; thine owne conſcience heaps up wound to wound, and plague to plague, which one day, as dammed Rivers, ſhall burſt in upon thee with more violence; as long feſtered wounds be more incurable, as an Army long a providing, come with greater terrour to Battle. Therefore it was not the leaſt point of wiſdome in <hi>Solomon,</hi> to preſſe this point. <hi>Eccleſ. 11. 9. Rejoyce O young man in thy youth, let thy heart chear thee in the daies of thy youth, and walk in the delight of thy heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes: But know, that for all theſe things, God will bring thee to judgment.</hi> God uſes to deal with ſinners, as Fiſhes do with their prey, after they have ſwallowed the hook, ſuffers them to play
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93936:54"/> and ſport with it to the end of the line, then ſtrikes it through their gills, and brings them back again. Thus much this forequoted ſpeech of <hi>Solomon</hi> imports, as if he had ſaid, You that ſolace your ſelves with all delights, in the heat of your blood; well, go on in your courſes, baniſh dull and ſad thoughts with the pureſt Wine, ſhake off your fits of melancholly, with peals of laughter, ſleep on in the laps of your <hi>Dalilah</hi>'s, chear up your ſelves with Pipe, and Tabret, and the ſweeteſt Muſick; yet a little more ſleep, a little more ſlumber, live on, as though there were no Heaven, no Hell, no Wrath, no Judgment: Yet, know this, and know it you muſt, that God hath his hook in your noſtrills, and ere long his wrath and fury ſhall wax hot againſt you like fire. <hi>Job</hi> goes about to inform gluttons, and worldly minded men, (men hardeſt of beliefe) in the truth of this Doctrine, <hi>Job. 20. 23. When he is about to fill his belly, God ſhall caſt the fury of his wrath upon him, and ſhall rain it upon him while he is eating. 27. The heaven ſhall reveal his iniquity, and the earth ſhall riſe up againſt him; the increaſe of his houſe ſhall depart, and his good ſhall flow away in the day of his wrath.</hi> Even the Church of God it ſelfe, that like a wanton Minion, had put far from her the evill day, was glad to confeſſe this, and that with ruefull moan to complain, <hi>Lam. 1. 12. Is it nothing to you, all ye that paſſe by, behold and ſee if there be any ſorrow like to my ſorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me, in the day of his fierce anger,</hi> A day of anger indeed. <hi>Lam. 2. 21. The young and the old lie on the ground in the ſtreets, my virgins and my young men are fallen by the ſword, thou haſt ſlain them in the time of thine anger, thou haſt killed, and not pittyed.</hi> Gods anger is ſuch a flame, as cannot be quenched,

They ſhall caſt their ſilver in the ſtreets, and their gold ſhall be removed; their ſilver and their gold ſhall not be able to deliver them, in the day of the wrath of the Lord.</hi> It is not Crownes imperiall, nor Thrones, nor Diadems, that can eſcape this day: <hi>Pſ. 110. 5. The Lord at thy right hand ſhall ſtrike through Kings, in the day of his wrath.</hi> Therefore the holy Ghoſt, to note the certainty of Gods anger, calls it a <hi>day of wrath, of fierce wrath; a day of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, hot diſpleaſure, heavy diſpleaſure; a day of Gods vengeance, Jer. 46. 10. A day of the Lord, and a cloudy day,</hi> Ezek. 30. 3. <hi>A day of darkneſſe and of gloomineſſe, a day of clouds and thick darkneſſe, Joel</hi> 2. 2. Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and reaſons further to confirm it, may be theſe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is drawn from the nature of God, who is of purer eyes, than to behold iniquity unpuniſhed; a conſuming fire, that the ſtubble is burned up before him; a God of glory, that <hi>Dagon</hi> cannot ſtand in his preſence; a light, that cannot dwell with darkneſſe; a jealous God, that burnes the chaffe with unquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable fire, wounds Kings, and ſpews all workers of iniquity out of his mouth. For, in Creatures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (by reaſon of the antipathy of their nature and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours) there is but a finite diſtance, there can ſcarce be any agreement; the Vine will not thrive in the ſame place with the Colwort, the Elephant is enraged at the ſight of a Ram, one Bird and Beaſt purſues ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with eager purſuit: Then how much more ſhall God, who is infinitely holy, everlaſtingly good, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally happy, threaten, puniſh, be angry at, take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon ſin, that abuſes his mercy, deſpiſes his
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93936:55"/> juſtice, defaces his image? What man will not take care to break a Cockatrice eggs, and kill a Serpent? And ſhall not God in the day of his fierce wrath, take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon ſin, which that old Serpent Satan brought into the world? The reaſon why men are not angry at thoſe crimes, that deſerve <hi>Phinehas</hi> his zeal, and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>'s indignation, is, becauſe our underſtanding cannot ſee the hainouſneſſe of them, our wills can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſufficiently deſire revenge, our affections with eagerneſſe purſue them. But God underſtands, and wills, and hates, as things are in themſelves, and as they deſerve.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Reaſon may be drawn from Gods Will, who juſtly decreed, to poure down the fierce Vialls of his wrath, in the day of his wrath, upon all diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient perſons: See <hi>Deuter.</hi> 28. the curſes and commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations God in his anger threatned to bring upon the people: See if he do not ſet apart the wicked for fuell of his wrath, againſt this day, <hi>Prov. 16. 5. The Lord made all things for himſelfe, yea even the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for the day of evill.</hi> Now if God be willing to poure out his heavy diſpleaſure upon thoſe, that diſpleaſe him, what can hinder his mighty arme for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming? Creatures indeed may be angry, but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times like Drones without ſtings, cannot hurt; as Canons charged with powder without ſhot, onely makes a roaring; like the Popes Bulls, threatens ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, hurts none but them whoſe conſciences are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved. <hi>Saul</hi> may be angry at <hi>David,</hi> but cannot finde him out; but, from Gods all-piercing eye, none can hide himſelfe. Satan may deſire to kill <hi>Job, Jonah</hi> may be angry till death for <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>niveh</hi>'s preſervation; yet, God puts a bitt in both their mouths, which if he be angry, nothing can be holden out of his reach. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93936:56"/> (if they take captives) may have the reſcued from them again, as <hi>Lot</hi> was from the King of <hi>Sodom;</hi> bought with a price, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> of the Iſhmaelites: But no power can reſcue us from Gods anger, no ranſome but Chriſts blood redeem us. Gods Will being ſet afoot, all his Attributes follow; if his Will ſay, Be angry, his Eye ſeekes out the object of his anger, and findes it; his wiſdome tempers the cup, his hand whets the ſword, his arme ſtrikes the blow. Thus you ſee, there is a time of Gods anger for ſin, becauſe he will have it ſo.</p>
                  <p>The third Reaſon, that there is a time when God is angry, is drawn from the cauſe, which in generall is ſin, and in ſpeciall, the contempt, and contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious deſpight we offer unto God, in every ſin we commit: The Apoſtle uſes the ſame reaſon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Thou treaſureſt up to thy ſelfe wrath againſt the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God. Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was angry at the three Children, for contempt of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of his Image, and threw them into the hot fiery Furnace; <hi>Daniel</hi> for the like was throwne into the Lions den. Shall Kings wrath burn thus like fire, for deſpiſing of their unlawfull decrees? and then ſhall not God, who is a conſuming fire, be angry at us vile wormes, for deſpiſing of his pure, holy, and wholſome Lawes, which the Angells dare not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without trembling? <hi>Eſau</hi> loſt his Birthright, for preferring a meſſe of Pottage before it; the Jewes ſmarted, for preferring <hi>Barabbas</hi> before Chriſt; <hi>Judas</hi> felt Gods wrath, for valuing our bleſſed Saviour at thirty pieces of ſilver.

                  <p>The fourth Reaſon may be taken from the effects, and execution of his anger; we ſee ſymptoms of Gods wrath in ſome, in their bodies, as <hi>Oehazie</hi>'s le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie; ſome, in lack of liberty, as <hi>Manaſſes;</hi> ſome in their children, as <hi>Eli;</hi> ſome in the gripes of a yelling conſcience, as <hi>Cain, Judas, Achi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Laſtly, in all reprobates at the laſt judgment, which will be a day of anger indeed, where his wrath ſhall ſeaze upon them for ever. Hitherto the Reaſons, the Uſes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: Firſt, of Information. And how God can be angry, in opening of the Text we toucht, to make way to that which followed; Let us further enquire wherein it conſiſts. When anger is ſaid to be a deſire of revenge, as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> imports, to deſire as ravinouſly as a hungry ſtomack does meat, an infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the blood about the heart, a ſorrow of the heart, for the contempt that is done to us, with an inkindling of indignation againſt the deſpiſer. Anger, as it is thus deſcribed, neither for the materiall nor formall, can belong to God, becauſe he is a pure Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, free from paſſion, all-ſufficient in himſelfe, cannot be croſſed in his abſolute will: Yet, in a ſenſe it is true, that Anger is in God, and that in theſe three reſpects.</p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:93936:57"/>
                  <p>Firſt, it argues his will, and moſt juſt decree of taking revenge, and puniſhing the injuries and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt offered to him, and his Church, as, <hi>Rom. 1. 18. The wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſſe;</hi> that is, God manifeſts by puniſhments, what he hath decreed from eternity. Secondly, it ſignifies the comminations and threatnings of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt ſinners; for, when God threatens to bring plagues and judgments, he is ſaid to be angry: <hi>Pſal. 6. 1. O Lord rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chaſten me in thy hot diſpleaſure;</hi> that is, do not puniſh me as thou threatens me, according to my ſins. Thirdly, it ſignifies the effects of his diſpleaſure, and the execution it ſelfe of thoſe plagues and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he had before decreed and threatned. Thus you ſee, God may be ſaid to be angry, becauſe in his will he decrees, in his word he threatens, in his wiſdome puniſhes. This may ſerve to confute that Stoicall opinion, that God cannot be angry, becauſe anger (ſay they) is a diſeaſe of the ſoul, that cannot ſurpriſe a wiſe man: Here they may ſee, that it dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates not, but ſuites with the wiſdome of him, who is wiſdome it ſelfe. Here the <hi>Epicures</hi> may ſee, how blaſphemouſly they diſhonour God, when they ſay, he ſits idle in Heaven, takes care for nothing, puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes none. How neer unto theſe are all our carnall Worldlings, that take their eaſe, eat, drink, and ſaie in their hearts, Tuſh, God cares not: Let them know, that for all this, though they eſcape a while unpuniſhed, he will bruiſe them in pieces with a rod of iron, like a potters veſſell,</p>
                  <p>The ſecond enquirie is, Seeing God in a ſenſe may be ſaid to be angry, whether anger be one of thoſe Attributes, that are imitable and warrantable in us,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93936:57"/> or no? We are commanded to be holy, as he is holy, mercifull as he is mercifull: But of anger, it may be doubted, becauſe it blindes the underſtanding, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the will, diſorders the affections. The truth is, anger is not onely warrantable, but ſometimes not to be angry is ſin. This may be proved by the example of Chriſt, <hi>Joel 2. 7. The zeal of thy houſe hath eaten me up.</hi> Zeal is a paſſion, mixt of anger and love; by his actions, in driving the buyers and ſellers out of the Temple; by precept, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 25. Be ye anry, and ſin not;</hi> that is, though anger in it ſelfe may be good, yet, the inordinateneſſe of it makes it a ſin, and that is three waies: Firſt, if we be angry raſhly, above meaſure, for ſleight or no cauſes. Secondly, if we be angry for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate injuries, and not for diſhonouring of God. Thirdly, if we be angry more for the hatred we bear to our brethren, than for their ſins. Otherwiſe to be angry at ſin, (if the action be ſtreaming in Chriſts blood) may be a meanes to aſſwage Gods anger for ſin.</p>
                  <p>Let the ſecond Uſe ſerve to examine our ſelves, whether we have provoked the Lord to anger, or no; And if; by what ſignes we may know the day of his anger is at hand: Firſt, whether we have provoked him to anger, may be known from the cauſe, which is the contempt, and contumacious deſpight we offer to God in every ſin; I'le onely name two or three which the Scripture often mentions, as the greateſt incentives of his anger. Firſt, Idolatry, a ſin that puts God out of his Throne, ſets up Idolls in his place; which is not only when we worſhip other Gods, but when we ſuffer riches, honour, beauty, pleaſure, to take up or ſoul, which ſhould be the holy Ghoſts temple. This is high treaſon againſt God;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93936:58"/> therefore how often ſhewed he his anger to the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, in fiery ſerpents, plagues, peſtilences, dearth, famine, ſword, and captivity. To this may be added, tempting of God, rebellion againſt God, that ſin of witchcraft, blaſphemy, hypocriſie, and profaning of the Lords Day.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond way whereby we may know, whether we have angered God, is, to examine our ſouls, whether we have been dutifull to Parents, obedient to Rulers, reverent to our Betters: The Scripture ſtyles them Gods; they that deſpiſe them, deſpiſe God, in as much as they are ranked among the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Deut. 27. 16. Curſed is he that ſetteth light by his father, or by his mother, and let all the people ſay, Amen.</hi> Nay, ſo great is Gods anger, that he threatens the Ravens ſhall pull out their eyes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Murderers, and thoſe that imbrue their hands in innocent blood, offer injury and deſpight unto God with a high hand, and therefore highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him: He that ſtabbs but at the Grand Sultan's Picture, is guilty of treaſon; then how ſhall the blood of his brother crie for vengeance againſt him, that defaces Gods Image in Man? witneſſe <hi>Cain</hi>'s ghaſtly conſcience, <hi>David</hi>'s broken bones, <hi>Judas</hi> burſten bowells, and the wrath of God againſt the Jewes, who cryed, <hi>His blood be upon us, and upon our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the wronging of Widows and Orphans, oppreſſing the poor and ſtrangers, are ſins that anger God: He hath promiſed to be a Husband to the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, a Father to the fatherleſſe, a ſuccour to the poor, a guide to the ſtranger: They that offer wrong to theſe, ſtrive to ſeparate thoſe, whom God hath wedded to himſelfe by holy affections, by promiſes,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93936:58"/> by his Son <hi>Jeſus:</hi> Therefore ſee what God ſaies; <hi>Exod. 22. 22. Ye ſhall not afflict any widow or father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe child; if thou afflict them in any wiſe, and they cri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> at all unto me, I will ſurely hear their cry, and my wrath ſhall wax hot; and I will kill you with the ſword, and your wives ſhal be widowes, and your children father leſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, all filthy, unnaturall, and abominable luſts of the fleſh, theſe rebell againſt the ſpirit, anger God the Father of ſpirits; witneſſe the adultery of <hi>David,</hi> for which, the ſword never departed from his houſe; thoſe thouſands of Benjamites that were ſlain, for abuſing the Levit's wife; thoſe Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> that were buried in the fiery flakes of brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. Thus we have diſcovered a few of the chiefeſt of thoſe ſins, that provoke Gods anger. By theſe, and all others, let us examine our ſouls, and ſit an <hi>audit</hi> in our conſciences, whether we have any ſhare in kindling of Gods anger or no. O that many mens conſciences did not tell them without examination, and that we did not ſee by daily experience, that, <hi>Hoſ. 4. 2. by ſwearing, and lying, and killing, and ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and committing of adultery, men break out that blood touches blood.</hi> Thus much for the Uſe of Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>The next Uſe is of Enquiry; if it be ſo, that we have angered God, how we may foreſee, and know the day of his anger. Mariners deſire to ſo ſee a ſtorm, diggers in Mines a damp, ſouldiers would be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned, that they may be fore-armed againſt the comming of their enemies. The tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h is, God for the moſt part keeps the expreſſe day of his anger, in his ſecret will to himſelfe, yet many times ſhewes, that it is near; and thoſe are either ſuch, as muſt infallib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y come to paſſe, as the laſt Judgment; or are revealed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93936:59"/> to us with a condition, as <hi>Niniveh</hi> ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if they repent not; <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be demoliſhed, if ſhe will not know the day of her viſitation; <hi>Judas</hi> ſhall ſmart for it, if he betray his Lord and Maſter. and theſe events which are conditionally propoſed to us, may be known three waies.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by the threatnings and menaces of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Miniſters, for they are his mouth, and as long as they ſpeak, his Word cannot lie. If the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet tell <hi>Zedechiah,</hi> that if he go to the Battle he muſt be ſlain, tarry at home he muſt, or die. If <hi>Daniel</hi> tell <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi> that God was angry at the great Tree, he muſt either give over his beaſtly luſts, or live with the beaſts. So when Gods Miniſters threaten a day of anger againſt any Nation, Citie, Family, for their proud tranſgreſſions, it muſt of neceſſity come to paſſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here or hereafter; be repented of here, or for ever puniſhed hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſigne, whereby we may know, that the day of Gods anger is at hand, are leſſer plagues, that he ſends as fore-runners and harbingers of ſeverer wrath; like <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> he firſt hangs out his Enſigne of peace, then his red Croſſe of juſtice, and muſters ſmaller plagues againſt us; if then we return not, and ſtrike a League, he hangs out his black Flag of impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable wrath, skirmaging and maſſacring, till neither Prince nor People, root nor branch be left. He is like a Man of war, diſcharges a warning-piece at his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, if they deſpiſe that, quits the Hatches of them with a ſecond, ſtrikes off their mani-Maſt with a third, and ſo ſinks them. He ſends little flaſhes, before the great thunder-crack come. Hence it is, that his anger is firſt compared to a ſmoak, then to a kindling of fire, then to a flame of fire, then to a conſuming
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93936:59"/> fire, then to an unquenchable fire. He ſent to the Egyptians Frogs, Lice, Locuſts, Murrain, Blood, Darkneſſe, Hail, Death of the Firſt-born, and laſtly an utter Overthrow. Chriſt, <hi>Matth,</hi> 24. having told <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of warrs, rumours of warrs, troubles, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, peſtilences, earthquakes, ends his ſpeech with a <hi>nondum finis,</hi> yet is not the end; theſe are but the beginnings of trouble. To apply. What ſhall we think God meant, by the late threatning of dearth and famine, ſuch ſtreams of blood-ſhed in our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Nations, feavours and peſtilences ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, as though the deſtroying Angell were ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at Rovers; I will not conclude, that his day of anger is at hand, and that he will make us the Butt, at which he will diſcharge his whole Quiver of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes; but this I ſay, that either repentance or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction muſt follow.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it the leaſt ſigne, that a day of vengeance is at hand, and that the Lord hath a controverſie with his people, when he takes holy and religious men, zealous Miniſters, from amongſt them. If a Seal be plucked from an Evidence, it argues the whole Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſhall be torn aſſunder, cancelled, throwne in the fire, burned. Godly men are as a Signet on Gods hand, Seales and Pledges, that he will not deſtroy the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous with the wicked; A royall Prieſthood, whom he oftentimes takes away, that they may not ſee the enſuing miſery; as Pearles pluck'd from Rings, Wheat gathered from the Tares, foretells, the one muſt to the furnace, to be new moulded, the other to the fire to be burn'd: As children taken from the breaſts of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers adjudged to die, that they may not ſee their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. Thus God ſent <hi>Lot</hi> and his Family out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and then rained down fire and brimſtone
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93936:60"/> upon them. After God had taken away the godly King <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> what miſeries and calamities, like waves one in the neck of another, purſued the Jewes, till their utter deſolation?</p>
                  <p>The third ſigne, whereby to know that a day of God's anger is at hand, is, his ſuffering of ſin long to raigne unpuniſhed. <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> had for his Enſigne, an Anchor, with a Dolphin painted in it; an Anchor, to ſignifie that he was ſlow in comming; a Dolphin, that he was fierce in taking revenge. It is the Tree that continues unpruned, that muſt be hewen down; the Oxen that go in fat Paſtures, that muſt to the ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: So ſinners, if God feed them, it is but to fat them for the knife; if he preſerve them, it is but for further judgment.</p>
                  <p>This is not the leaſt token, that God hath ſealed us up (unleſſe we repent) for the day of his anger. What heart, though harder than Adamant, would not bleed, to think of the ſcourges of other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Countries, The ſtreets running with blood, the Cities burning with fire, the children ſlain in the parents ſight, the old gray heads dyed in crimſon blood, the young led into captivity; while, while we are hedg'd about on every ſide with peace, wallow in abundance; and, which is worſe, in unthankfulneſſe, in ſin. What good could we not yet promiſe this our Nation? But when the Streets rings with ſwearing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſſe, Markets are ſtained with lying, oppreſſing, and couſenage; the Taverns and Innes abound with filthy vomitings, wickedneſſe raignes in every ſtate, every condition, every place; ſhall we ſtill put far from us the evill day?</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, we have angred God, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he be appeaſed, the day of his anger is at hand.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93936:60"/> The third Uſe is of Inſtruction, how to prevent it, and that is by repentance: Firſt, taking a ſtrict exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our ſelves, how often, in what manner, in what meaſure, we have angred God. A Phyſician muſt firſt know the diſeaſe, before he can apply the cure. Then we muſt be heartily ſorry, that we have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded God; this godly ſorrow muſt work like a ſtrong potion, work in the underſtanding, in the will, in the affections, in the conſcience, bruiſe the bones, twinge the ſpirit, break the heart. Thirdly, we muſt aggravate it, by remembring, that we have not onely angered Men and Angells, but Chriſt that dyed for us. No heat of fire, nor knock of hammers, can break the Adamant; but annoint it with the hot blood of a Goat, it falls in ſplinters. Not precepts, not threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, not judgments, can make a ſtony heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite, till God in Chriſt move it. Fourthly, we muſt forſake our ſins, whereby we have angered God. The <hi>Scolapendra</hi> when ſhe hath ſwallowed an hook, vomits out her bowells with it, and ſo is quit. When we have ſwallowed iniquity, that the guilt thereof ſtings us, let us vomit and ſpew out our darling pleaſures, pluck out our eye of luſt, cut off our hand of revenge, belch out our heart of pride, and ſo in the reſt.

                  <p>Hitherto the firſt point, that if we continue in ſin, God will be angry. The ſecond followes, That when
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93936:61"/> God is angry, none can ſtand in his ſight, or abide it; or, That the anger of God is a terrible, unſpeakable, unſupportable, intolerable burden. Every word in the Text hath a ſpeciall Emphaſis to prove this; <hi>Who may ſtand? Who?</hi> ſhall Angells? they are but like refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted beams or raies, if God ſhould hide his face, they would ceaſe to ſhine. Shall Man? his glory and pomp, like the colours in the Rainbow, vaniſhes away, when God puts forth in anger the brightneſſe of his face. Shall Devills? If he ſpeak the word, they are tumbled down from Heaven like lightning. <hi>Stand in thy ſight. [Stand.]</hi> What! a Reed againſt a Cedar, a Thiſtle in <hi>Lebanon</hi> againſt a Cedar in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt a Flame, a Graſhopper againſt an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, a head of Glaſſe againſt a head of Braſſe. <hi>When once thou art angry. [Angry.]</hi> By ſending out his wrath, that it wounds like arrowes; angry, in pouring it out, that it drownes like water; angry, in kindling of it, that it burnes like fire; nay, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire, but that may be quenched; an unquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable fire, but that may ceaſe to burn, when it lacks matter; an everlaſting fire, that never goes out, That, that's it; ſuch anger as is never fully ſhown, but in puniſhment of Reprobates; in no puniſhment, but that in Hell; in none in Hell, but that eternall.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to prove, that Gods anger is terrible, we need go no further, but to the godly, to ſeek it: How have the ſtout-hearted pulled in their horns, and melted like Snailes? Snailes (as Naturaliſts ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve) put in ſalt, diſſolve into water: How hath it grinded them to duſt? Hear <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 32. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, that his <hi>bones waxed old, and that his moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture was turned into the drought of ſummer.</hi> Hear him houl and cry, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. that his <hi>daies were conſumed</hi>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:93936:61"/> 
                     <hi>like ſmoak;</hi> that his <hi>bones burned like hearth, withered like graſſe;</hi> that he was <hi>become like a pelican in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, or a ſparrow on the houſe top.</hi> Hear <hi>Job</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. that his <hi>griefe was heavier then the ſand of the ſea;</hi> that <hi>the arrowes of the Almighty were within him, the poyſon had drunk up his ſpirit; the terrours of God had ſet themſelves in array againſt him.</hi> Secondly, that Gods anger is unſpeakable, we can all tell, how great, none can tell; it's like God himſelfe, infinite in greatneſſe, and (unleſſe he in mercy put an end to it) it's like eternity, infinite in time, eternall: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Saints have thought no Rhetorick ſufficient enough to expreſſe it in, but ſighes; no tongue, but ſcrikes and groans; no inke would caſt, but tears; no paper, but a wounded heart; no words of force, but exclamations of deſpair, and ſuch as iſſue from a blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſoul. As Lines drawn from the Circumference meet in the Centre, and pierce it through, yet no part of them is comprehended in it; ſo, many arrowes of Gods anger may meet in us, pierce us through, but expreſſe them we cannot; nay, when we are in the greateſt agonies, As burning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſes by reflection of the beams of the Sun, cauſe heat and burning, which is not in the Sun, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents not the leaſt glory of the Sun; So we can better expreſſe our paſſions, than unfold the weight of that mighty arme that ſmites us. Thirdly, that the anger of God is unſupportable, we need no other inſtance but of our bleſſed Saviour: He that makes the Heavens roul without an axel-tree, cauſes the Earth to hang in the Aire, as a ball poyſed without pillars, puts bounds to the waves of the Sea, ſtaggering over the banks; He ſweat and bled, and groaned under this burden: We have heard tell of finite Creatures, that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93936:62"/> have endured mangling of bodies, ripping of bowells, racking of joynts, burning of fleſh, boyling in oyle; but under this ſtroak, he that was God and Man, was in a ſenſe compelled to cry out, <hi>O God my God, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi> Fourthly, that the anger of God is intolerable, <hi>Judas, Cain,</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> could tell before their deaths, and, it is to be feared, better ſince; and many reprobates in this life are ſo racked, that it pierces the whole Man; head, heart, ſide, back, all parts at once ake, and ſweat, and tremble; the eye ſees no comfort, the tongue taſtes no comfort, the ear hears no comfort; and as there is no eaſe within, ſo no comfort without, no place, nor bed, nor board, nor houſe, nor Church; no creature, nor meat, nor drink, nor friend, nor wife, nor child, will afford any comfort: How many have found a weight beyond the weight of mountains, lying upon their ſoules, and wiſh, that they had rather been famiſhed or ſtarved, or burned, or ſtrangled long before, and catch and call for death, for hell, leap out of the fire into the flame. And if this be the arraignment of God's anger in this life, what will be the terrible execution hereafter.</p>
                  <p>You may have this proved by examples; God was angry at the Angells, and they fell down into the loweſt pit; he was angry at <hi>Adam,</hi> and he was throwne out of Paradiſe; he was angry at the old World, and they were drowned in the Flood; angry at <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and they were burned with fire and brimſtone; angry at <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and he was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the waves; angry at <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and they were ſwallowed quick to hell; he was angry at <hi>Senacherib,</hi> and the Angell ſlew a hundred fourſcore and five thouſand of his Army in one night; he was
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93936:62"/> angry at the Jewes, and raſed their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ie to the ground, and ſcattered them as vagabonds over the face of the whole earth; angry at all reprobates, and will caſt them out of his preſence for ever. Thus you ſee we range over the Scriptures, yet not out of the narrow bounds of the Text, as lines from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference meet in one centre, and ſpoaks of a wheel in one axeltree, poynts all at Gods anger; for, what Man, what Angell can <hi>ſtand in his ſight, when once he is angry?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the reaſon we will give of this Doctrine, ſhall be the infinite diſproportion betwixt God and Man; when there is not a creature to a creature, weakneſs to weakneſſe; but a finite muſt encounter with an infinite power, weakneſſe muſt fight with ſtrength, man with God, how can there be any ſtanding? Firſt, of Gods power. Secondly, of mans weakneſſe. He that made all things of nothing, can, if he pleaſe, return all things to nothing; the Heavens will paſſe away at his anger as a ſmoak, the Hills melt, the Earth tremble, the raging Sea is dryed up, and all creatures couch before him like Lambs. Thus God can do without means what he pleaſes, and when he pleaſes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what means to be rods of his wrath he will, he can ſend upon their bodies, conſumptions, feavours, extream burnings, botch of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſcab, itch, and peſtilence; make the Heaven over our heads like braſſe, the Earth like iron, rain down powder and duſt, ſmite the corn with mildew and blaſting, ſend famine and ſword, ſtrike our ſoules with blindneſſe, mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and aſtoniſhment of heart. Now what is man that he ſhould ſtand againſt all theſe? a flower that's cut down, a ſhadow that continues not, a cloud that's conſumed, a dream that vaniſhes, a ſhepheard's
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93936:63"/> tent that is removed, a ſmoak that is ſcattered with the Sun-beams, and at the beſt, but the untimely fruit of a woman, that afore we be in life, we are in the midſt of death. Thus the Reaſons, the Uſes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Firſt, of Information.</p>

God could with one blaſt of his fury conſume them to nothing, but he deales with them,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93936:63"/> as the Turks with their Gally-ſlaves, adjudges them to perpetuall ſlavery.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Uſe may let us ſee, that no ſtrength, no riches, no wiſdome, no nation, no army, no city, can continue long, when once they have angered God; If ſtrength, then <hi>Goliah, Sehon, Og</hi> the King of <hi>Baſhan,</hi> might have boaſted; if riches, the rich Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and the Fool in the Goſpell, might have ſung on their Requieme; if wiſdome, <hi>Solomon</hi> had been ſecure; if Kingdoms, the Jewes, and the three Monarchies had ſtill flouriſhed; if Armies, <hi>Senacherib</hi>'s had not been defeated; if Cities, <hi>Jeruſalem, Tyre, Sidon,</hi> and <hi>Niniveh</hi> had ſtill ſtood. This is it that made <hi>Solomon</hi> ſay, <hi>Prov. 21. 30. There is no wiſdome, no underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, no counſell againſt the Lord.</hi> This made <hi>Jeremie</hi> ſay. <hi>Jer. 9. 23. Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdome, neither let the mighty man glory in his might; let not the rich man glory in his riches.</hi> This made <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>Pſal. 2. 12. If his wrath is kindled,</hi> tantillum, <hi>but a little; quantillum,</hi> how little, O bleſſed Saint? that, he knows not: But after a long extaſie or trance, breaks off his Apoſiopeſis with this Epiphonema, <hi>Bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may learn alſo from hence, that all earthly comforts are but croſſes, all worldly bleſſings are but curſings, when Gods anger once begins to flame. God was angry at <hi>Eli,</hi> and his own children burſt his heart; angry at <hi>David,</hi> and his beloved <hi>Abſolom</hi> conſpires againſt him; angry at <hi>Senacherib,</hi> and his own ſons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue their hands in his blood; he was angry at <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and his wiſdome was but vexation of ſpirit; all his riches and honour, but vanity of vanities; his Wives, Children, Horſes, Chariots, and all his worldly pleaſures, like buckets of Oyle thrown into
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93936:64"/> the flame, increaſes the burning; he was angry at <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> and all things work together for his ſorrow; that he had been Chriſts Diſciple wounds him, that he had preached the Goſpell wounds him, that he had wrought miracles wounds and galls his ſoul. Thirdly, obſerve, that all other wounds they are but ripples, all other flames they are but ſparkles, in compariſon of Gods anger; diſeaſes of the body, Gout, Stone, Strangury, bloody Flux may be cured; Plague, Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Dearth, Famine, may be abated: Puniſhments of the body, Rods, Swords, Racks, Wheeles, Flames, Strapadoes, may be endured: I ones Eſtate, poverty, nakedneſſe, impriſonment: In ones name, ſlanders, reproaches, defamations, falſe witneſſes: In the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, captivity, overthrow, utter deſolation, in ſome ſenſe, may be undergone: But, before Gods anger, who can ſtand? This breaks the leggs, looſes the joynts, conſumes the marrow, burns up the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, dries the moyſture, wounds the heart, deads the ſoul, and murders the conſcience. In this Epilepſie, all parts fail at once, till God be pacified; in that Apoplexie they lie for ever, whom God in his anger leaves.</p>
                  <p>The third Uſe may ſerve, to reprove three ſorts of men: Firſt, thoſe blaſphemous <hi>Rabſheca</hi>'s, whoſe words, works, lives, ſhew, they defie Gods anger, like the <hi>Cyclopes</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> that deſpiſed <hi>Jove</hi>'s thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts; like <hi>Darius,</hi> that writ a Letter of defiance to the River <hi>Xanthus,</hi> for drowning his Horſe; like the Cicilians, that made war againſt the mountain <hi>Aetna,</hi> for ſpoiling their corn fields, but were buried under the ſands thereof, and flakes of fire; this is the lot of all that anger God. But ſome <hi>Machiavel</hi> or State-politician will ſay, we have Riches, Artillery,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93936:64"/> ſtrong Towers to defend us. So had <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but when ſhe had anger'd God, ſhe could not ſtand. But our enemies are weak. O conſider, he can without means of man overthrow, as he did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the red Sea, <hi>Iericho</hi> with the ſound of Rams horns; with weak means, as a thouſand with <hi>Samſon</hi>'s jaw-bone, <hi>Goliah</hi> with <hi>David</hi>'s ſling. But the rich cormorant will ſay, What need we fear plague, famine hunger? we keep alone from all company, our tables are full of dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, our granaries are full of corn, and mony we have enough to ſupply. Conſider, He that could ſlay ſo many of <hi>David</hi>'s, of <hi>Senacherib</hi>'s Army in one night, can ſend the peſtilence in thy meat, in thy drink, in every blaſt of aire thou drawes: He that took away holy <hi>Iob</hi>'s ſubſtance in one day, may juſtly confound thee in a moment; that if thou like a flie flutter againſt this flame, thou will be forced one day to cry out, as did <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtat, when he was wounded with an arrow from heaven, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Thou haſt conquered, O Ieſus of Galilee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, this reproves thoſe, that when God is angry, adde flame to flame, firebrand to firebrand. Does God threaten ſcarcity and want, then be ſure at this time drunkenneſſe and gluttony will moſt abound. Does God ſmite with diſeaſes of the body, as peſtilence, burning Feavours, &amp;c? then laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wantonneſſe, uncleanneſſe of the fleſh, whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, adultery, and the like. Does he ſhut up any in their houſes, with the ſeales of his judgments? then there will be the moſt ſtealing, even out of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected houſes; when his judgments will not come to them, they will find them out. Is not this to ſtand in defiance againſt Gods anger?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this reproves thoſe, that murmur againſt
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93936:65"/> God, for ſending his rod of anger to correct us, when our ſins have deſerved the ſword to kill us. If he ſhould ſend the enemy amongſt us, and you ſhould ſee your daughters raviſhed, your ſons butchered before your eyes, would not this be bitter? If we ſhould ſee our Townes and Cities on fire, our ſtreets running with blood, all in a skirmage and uproar at once, would not this be bitter? Should your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren fall in the ſtreets for bread, die for thirſt, they ready to eat you up, you ready to chop them for the pot, would not this be bitter? All this we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, all this Gods anger threatens, all this we ſhall have, unleſſe we repent. O let's now prevent this, that we may never ſee nor feel it. The Word of God is againſt us, the decree is come out, moſt of thoſe ſins that have brought captivity, ſword, famine, upon other Nations, are amongſt us; we ſee the Lord hath begun already, and our Brethren have begun to us in this bitter cup. O the bitter lamentations of <hi>Germany,</hi> Fathers, Mothers, weeping for their Sons that be not. O <hi>England, England,</hi> look to it, that we drink not of the dregs. O that you would faſt and mourn in publick; O that you would each in private, pray earneſtly, and ſay, O Lord, ſpare our Nation, our houſes, our ſons and daughters; ſpare them from the ſword, from famine, from peſtilence, from miſery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and who knowes, but the Lord may yet have mercy, turn away his anger, that we may not fall, but ſtand in his ſight for ever.</p>

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93936:66"/> and <hi>Iordan,</hi> before we come at <hi>Canaan;</hi> go through the Wine-preſſe, before we drink of the Grape in the Kingdome of Heaven. Some have, and ſome ſtill muſt go through a purgatory of rods, ſwords, racks, wheeles, flames, ſtrapadoes, (in this life) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be carryed in a charriot of triumph into glory. We may proſecute this Argument, launching in blood of Martyrs to the knees, whole clouds of tears of afflicted Prophets, Apoſtles, Saints, who are now noble, and thrice renowned in Heaven, who had no other Armes upon the earth, but the Croſſe; no Coat but Sable; no Badge, but the marks of Chriſt; no Creſt, but Confidence; no Supporters, but Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; no Field, but <hi>Aceldama,</hi> a field of blood. This is the Watchword our Saviour gives his Souldiers, and the Motto in his Banner, <hi>Matth. 16. 24. If any man wil follow me, let him forſake himſelf, and take up his croſſe, and follow me.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies to <hi>Timothy, All that will live godly in Chriſt Ieſus, muſt ſuffer perſecution.</hi> We are Chriſtians, and our lives begins, <hi>baptiſmate fluminis,</hi> conſecrated in the waters of affliction; goes on <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmate flaminis,</hi> confirmed in the fire of affliction; and oftentimes ends <hi>baptiſmate ſanguinis,</hi> waft on Rivers of blood, covers our Hearſe with a ſcarlet die to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, and that for theſe cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, thereby God proves us, whether we be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and true, and manifeſts to others our ſincerity; they are a touchſtone of tryall, to examine, whether we be pure or reprobate gold. The Eagle tries her young ones, whether they be baſtards, by making them look at the Sun; ſo God tries us by the heat of tribulation. As <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Souldiers were proved at the water, ſo we at the waters of affliction. Faith, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was but fained, will then vaniſh into ſmoak, like
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93936:67"/> 
                     <hi>Sodom</hi>'s apples, guilded hypocriſie into vapours: but true Faith ſet upon the file, will be more reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Hope more certain, Zeal more blazing, Charity more perfect.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, afflictions are a means to wean us from the world, and win us unto God, as Mirrhe and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes, to lay on the paps of worldly pleaſures, to make us flie to Chriſt, a <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to purſue us out of <hi>Egypt</hi> unto <hi>Canaan:</hi> they are a rod of God, to turn our Rivers of delight (when we are bewitched with them) into blood; they are a worm, to make our Manna ſtink, when we luſt after it: This brought the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Son to his Father, the Iſraelites from Captivity, the diſeaſed unto Chriſt. Is the Arke taken, and the glory of <hi>Iſrael</hi> departed, then the Houſe of <hi>Ely</hi> will begin to think upon God. Is <hi>David</hi> baniſhed unto <hi>Gath?</hi> then happy are they that are but dore-keepers in the houſe of God, or the ſparrowes that may build their neſts there. Is <hi>Iſrael</hi> led into captivity? then will the daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> hang up their Harps upon the willowes, when they remember thee, O <hi>Sion.</hi> Is any afflicted? then ſurely they will pray.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, afflictions are medicinall reſtoratives, by which ſinners may be awaked to recover their health by repentance; they are the launcing knife in the Phlebotomie of the ſoul, to wound us, that neither the Plethora, or rankneſſe of blood, honour, riches, preferment, pleaſure, choak and ſtifle the ſpirit; nor the Cacochymia or peſtilent humours of ſin, as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, pride, intemperance, bring us into the Hectick feavour, or incurable diſeaſe of hardneſſe of heart, rebellion, or ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt. They are a rod to ſcourge us in a Lethargy: As Phyſicians
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93936:67"/> in a Lethargy uſe to burn the hair of the patient, and ſmoak it into his noſtrills; ſo afflictions burn vanities and darling pleaſures, which are but as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and caſts them as dung into our noſtrills: They are preparative potions to repentance, pills of contrition, purgations of naturall corruptions, vomits of ſin, tents to ſearch our wounds, ſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications to draw out ill humours. And though no afflictions be pleaſant for the preſent, yet afterwards they are cordialls of comfort, reſtauratives of grace. Thus God taught <hi>Miriam</hi> by leproſy, to leave her murmuring; he awakened <hi>Jonah</hi> out of ſleep, by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting him into the Sea; he cured <hi>Zacharie</hi> of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, by ſtriking him with dumbneſſe; delivered <hi>Saul</hi> from his evill courſe by blindneſſe; <hi>David</hi> from pride, by the plague; cured him of adultery, by kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the child. Bleſſed is the man whom the Lord thus correcteth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, as afflictions are reſtauratives for mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by-paſt, ſo they are preſervatives and antidores to prevent the evill to come. As a man, whoſe blood is conſumed in a lingring feavour, is not ſo apt to take the peſtilence, ſo neither a man afflicted, to be puffed up with pride, or burn with luſt, he need not fear the ſwelling of that Carbuncle. They are ſalt to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from putrefaction, a ſtormie winde to ſave our ſtanding pools from corruption, a fiery Cherubim, to keep us out of the forbidden paradiſe of ſin: As the golden hair was to <hi>Niſus,</hi> a ſafeguard from his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſo the croſſe of affliction armes from the fleſh, the world, and the devill. As is ſaid in the Fable of <hi>Achilles,</hi> ſo far as he was dipped in the water, ſo far he was unpiercible by any weapon; ſo far as we are plunged in the waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> our ſpirituall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93936:68"/> have leſſe power over us. God ſent an Angell of Satan to buffet <hi>Paul,</hi> not ſo much for any evill he had done, as to prevent ſin for the time to come, leſt through the abundance of revelations, he ſhould be exalted above meaſure. If God inflict upon us <hi>malum poenae,</hi> the evill of puniſhment, it is to prevent <hi>malum culpae,</hi> the evill of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, by afflictions we are prepared and poliſhed for Heaven, that as the one ſcale of tribulation preſſes us down, the other of grace may mount us up. Our Oyle of grace is a quinteſſence, that muſt be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by fire, our cordiall waters of comfort by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation, our Grapes ſqueazed in the Wine-preſſe of ſorrow, our Wheat flayled in the threſhing-floor of tribulation, our Flowre grinded between the milſtones of preſſure: We are Gold that muſt be purified ſeven times in the Furnace, before we be carryed into the Sanctuary; Trees that muſt be pruned, before they bring forth any fruit; living Stones, that muſt be poliſhed and hammered, before they be brought into the heavenly <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> So that to a Chriſtian, all his whole life is as it were a threſhing, death is the fan to winnow the pure wheat from the chaffe, that we may be gathered into the heavenly Granary, where no unclean thing ſhall enter.</p>
                  <p>Well then, if every Chriſtian muſt feel the ſting of theſe fiery Serpents, before he come at <hi>Canaan,</hi> learn we to make account of them, not murmur, mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wonder at them. In this vale of tears, we muſt look to be fed with the bread of affliction, to drink the bitter water, gall, wormwood, and eat the ſoure grape of ſorrow. Shall the heavens mourn, the clouds ſhed their tears, the earth tremble, the fruits be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, the ſea rage, the creatures groan for our ſins,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93936:68"/> and we not ſympathize with them? Shall the Prophets and Apoſtles go through the fire, the Martyrs have their robes dyed in ſcarlet, our Saviour ſweat water and blood, conflict with hell, Satan, death, and we go to heaven in a bed of roſes, tread on carpets, ride ſtill in triumph upon the wings of pleaſure? True it is, in former times, we enjoyed Halcyon daies of peace, ſitting under our own Vines and Fig-trees, ſinging the ſong of <hi>Sion,</hi> and tuning our own harps in a melodious harmony, having no Townes but <hi>Salems,</hi> no men but friends; if we had gone into the fields, we ſhould have ſeen no ſpears but ſtanding corn, have heard no drums but tabrets, no out-cries, but harveſt-homes, had no years but of Jubilee, no daies but of rejoycing. But now of a long continuance, (by reaſon of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe) all places have become <hi>Aceldamaes,</hi> hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of blood, fields of blood, ditches of blood, towns of blood, Churches of blood, in this land, that was once <hi>Inſula pacis,</hi> an Iſland of peace. Lord water our eyes with tears of godly ſorrow, like <hi>Gideon</hi>'s fleece, while others are drie, that we may be drie, &amp; ſaved from thoſe waters of afflictions, wherein others are drowned; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in us fruits of contrition worthy of repentance, and then repent, that thou haſt ſent this ſpirit of diviſion, and deſtroying Angell amongſt us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this neceſſity of afflictions, may comfort Gods children in all troubles, on this conſideration, that afflictions are ſent of God, conſecrated by his Son Jeſus Chriſt, ſuffered of all Saints that are now triumphant in Heaven; that he that ſowes in tears, ſhall reap in joy; that he that wears a Crown of thorns with Chriſt here, ſhall wear a Crown of glory with him in heaven hereafter: Seriouſly meditating in our hearts, that God afflicts us not in fury, but in mercy,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93936:69"/> and that for theſe ends: 1. That he may draw us from the Love of the world. 2. That he may cure our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſickneſſes. 3. That he may preſerve us from fearfull falling into damnable ſins. 4. That he may deliver us from the wrath to come, and the torments of hell. 5. To try and examine the ſincerity of our faith. 6. To make us run unto God, the fountain of living waters. 7. That God might ſhew his outſtrech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed arme in delivering us. 8. That they may be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified to the increaſe of our glory. Now our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are of two ſorts, either internall in ſoul, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall; theſe, either in our names, or in our goods, or in our perſons; here we have comfort againſt all: Is any in priſon? look upon the Irons entring into <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s ſoul, and yet delivered. Is any in baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? look upon <hi>David,</hi> reſtored from thence to a Kingdom. Is any hungred, ſtarved, naked, full of ſoars? look upon <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſome. Is any afflicted with loſſe of goods, health, children? look upon <hi>Job</hi>'s triumph after miſery. Does any ſuffer for conſcience ſake? look upon the crowned Martyrs in heaven. Is any a man of ſorrowes? look upon Chriſt, before whoſe Throne, Angells, Saints, and Cherubims, throw down their Crownes and Palms of glory.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the neceſſity of afflictions may teach us, not baſely to fear them, but rather fear ſin, that laies us naked to Gods fierce indignation, and the malice of our enemies; fear indiſcretion, that creates unto us many needleſſe troubles; fear ſuperſtition and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, for that makes a man miſtake his cauſe; fear ſingularity and preſumption, ſo as to reſt upon our own ſufficiency. Theſe are worſe then affliction, as much as the ſin is worſe then the puniſhment.</p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:93936:69"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, the neceſſity of them, may make us lift up our eyes at Him, that rules the wheel of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. No affliction ſprings out of the duſt, but comes from God; he hath tempered the cup, and ſaid, Drink this; Chriſt could not eſcape it, though he beſought it thrice with tears, and then ſhall we? Our ſins deſerved afflictions to the full, God turned them to our good. <hi>Moſes</hi> at the firſt called the Rod his, but when he had wrought miracles with it, it was God's: The rod of affliction is Gods, let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore kiſſe it; <hi>Thy rod and thy ſtaffe</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) hath comforted me.</hi> Swine feed upon Acorns, and look not up at the Tree; Doggs ſnarl at the ſtone, and mind not the hand that threw it: But <hi>David</hi> minded <hi>Shimei</hi> not ſo much that curſed him, as God that ſent that ſhame upon him. A Chriſtian that makes this right uſe of afflictions, is the worlds wonder, with the buſh, in which Jehovah appeared to <hi>Moſes,</hi> he burns, and yet conſumes not. <hi>Hananiah</hi> the falſe Prophet broke off the timber yoke from <hi>Jeremie</hi>'s neck, but had one of iron put upon his own. He that burnes God's Rod, ſhall be beatt with Scorpions.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, if this life be a paſſage through the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of afflictions, then here we are not perfect as we would be. The word is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>paſſe through afflictions;</hi> Every paſſage is a motion, every motion (as the Philoſopher ſaid) is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an imperfect act, moving for an end, running for a goal; this end, this goal, is the Kingdom of God; for, <hi>We muſt through much affliction enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the ſecond Propoſition offers it ſelfe, That through theſe afflictions, or waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> we ſhall at length come to heaven. This is ſomewhat ſweeter, and ſugars the former, therefore I beſeech
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93936:70"/> you obſerve it. For a ſtorm here, we ſhall have a calm; for Chriſt's croſſe, an eternall Crown; our nights of mourning ſhall be turned into Halcyon daies; for months of affliction, we ſhall have years of jubilee; for a rod of correction, we ſhall have a palme of victory; our mournfull Elegies of lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſhall be turned into Hallelujah's of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. With this, <hi>Athanaſius</hi> comforted the Saints under <hi>Iulian</hi>'s perſecution, that affliction was but <hi>nubecula citò tranſitura,</hi> a ſtorm that would quickly end in a ſunſhine or calm: So did our Saviour his diſciples, <hi>Matth. 5. 10. Bleſſed are they that ſuffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for righteouſneſſe ſake, for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven:</hi> Nay, as if they were already in the ſuburbs of glory, <hi>v. 12. Rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven.</hi> Take up the perſpective glaſſe of Faith, and look towards Heaven, and there you ſhall ſee the noble Army of Martyrs, Prophets, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, Evangeliſts, ſet down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> in the Kingdome of God; yet, if you look at their journall towards heaven, you may trace them by their blood. Theſe afflictions are ſometimes called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>This then may ſerve for a ground of comfort to every ſoul, diſtreſſed with the tedious bitterneſſe of this life; for ſhort ſorrow here, we ſhall have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall joy; for a little hunger, an eternall banquet; for light ſickneſſe and affliction, everlaſting health and ſalvation; for a little impriſonment, endleſſe liberty; for diſgrace, glory: In ſtead of the wicked to oppreſſe and afflict them, they ſhall have the Angells and Saints to comfort and ſolace them; in ſtead of Satan to torment and tempt them, they ſhall have Chriſt Jeſus to raviſh and affect them.

It was well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that the firſt Martyrs that ſuffered for Chriſt, were Innocents; and as well ſaid, <hi>Non ſupplicium, ſed cauſa facit Martyrem,</hi> Not the puniſhment, but the cauſe maketh the Martyr.</p>
                  <p>Who ſuffered more then the <hi>Cicumcelliones,</hi> thoſe Donatiſts, in this Father's time, and yet no Crown.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93936:73"/> In the former branch is conſiderable, firſt, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which are two, the one young <hi>Samuel</hi> revealing, who by this occaſion received <hi>primam tonſuram,</hi> his firſt unction to prophecy; the other is old <hi>Eli,</hi> who like <hi>Sexagenarius de ponte,</hi> as his bodily, ſo his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall eyes grew dim; for, 1 <hi>Sam. 3. 1. The word of the Lord was pretious in thoſe daies, there was no open viſion.</hi> Secondly, we have the thing revealed, which is either the ſin, or the puniſhment of ſin; ſin, either the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eli</hi>'s, for not correcting and chaſtiſing his ſons; or the ſin of his ſons, <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prieſts of the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam. 2. 12. were ſons of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liall, knew not the Lord;</hi> by their rapine made <hi>men abhor the daily ſacrifice. 17. lay with the women that aſſembled at the dore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation,</hi> 22. The puniſhment of ſin either threatned firſt by a man of God, not otherwiſe named, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 27. ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by <hi>Samuel</hi> himſelfe, that the Lord would <hi>cut off the whole family of Eli from the prieſthood, and that the iniquity of his houſe ſhould not be purged with ſacrifice nor offering for ever, 1 Sam.</hi> 3. 14. Or executed in the fourth Chapter, for thirty thouſand of the Iſraelites were put to the ſword, the whole Camp ſcattered, <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas</hi> the Prieſts ſlain, the Ark of God taken captive by the Philiſtims: the Wife of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nehas</hi> hearing of it, fell into the pangs of childbirth, and was delivered of a Son, calling his name <hi>Ichobod, the glory is departed from Iſrael,</hi> and ſo expired; and at the relation of the meſſenger, <hi>Eli</hi> being ninty eight years old, fell back from his chair, and brake his neck. Thus the whole Family was dyſaſtered, <hi>rarò antecedentem ſceleſtum deſeruit pede poena claudo. Seneca.</hi> Puniſhment and ſhame like a blood-hound, alwaies purſues ſin at the heeles; the Ark was taken, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93936:73"/> routed, the Prieſts ſlain, <hi>Phinehas</hi> his Wife peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the after-pangs, <hi>Eli</hi> brake his neck. Hence obſerve, that ſin is the deſerving cauſe, procuring the ruine and calamity of Church and State, Cities and Families.</p>
                  <p>Sin it is, that infects our pureſt aire, that damps our richeſt mines, that poyſons our ſweeteſt dainties, that laies thornes in our ſofteſt beds of down, that undermines Palaces, pulls down Crowns, ſhakes Thrones, and ruinates Kingdomes; that ſets all mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Wights at oppoſition, heat againſt cold, cold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt heat, winter and ſummer, light and darkneſſe, moyſture and drought, in arms one againſt another. That the whole world is become a boyling furnace of contradictions, where man is the mettall, the body is the droſſe, which muſt firſt be burned by the refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fire of death, before the ſoul can become pure gold, fit for the heavenly Sanctuary. For the proof of this, hear <hi>Jeremie</hi>'s lamentation, <hi>Lam. 3. 39. Wherefore is the living man ſorrowfull?</hi> Heaven and earth anſwers his Interrogatory, with a ſoul's ſad Eccho, <hi>Man ſuffereth for his ſins.</hi> Come on further; and ſee all Creatures, Angells, Men, Beaſts, Plants, Elements, Heavens, in ſorrowes diſcord, ſighing out the ſad Epitaphium of mans mortality, 42. <hi>We have ſinned and rebelled, therefore thou haſt not ſpared, thou haſt covered us with wrath, and perſecuted us, thou haſt ſlain, and not ſpared. Rom. 6. 23. The wages of ſin is death.</hi> As tooth for tooth, eye for eye, hand for hand, one talent for another; ſo death is a deſerved reward for ſin, death firſt ſeizing upon the body while we live, by the canker of corruption and mortality, bringing at the length death of the body by diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and all this hatched and brooded under the Coca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93936:74"/> ſin. Come on, and travail with St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, 1 Cor. 11. 3. For this cauſe</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>many are weak amongſt you, and ſick, and many ſleep. For this cauſe,</hi> that is, for the poyſon of ſin, the canker of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in generall; for ſpilling of our Saviour's blood, piercing his ſide, nailing his feet, unworthy receiving of the holy Sacrament in particular. <hi>Are ſick,</hi> that is, feavours boyle you, conſumptions waſte you, plague and peſtilence devour you. <hi>And many ſleep,</hi> ſleep in an everlaſting Lethargy and apoplexie of death, never to be awaked before the laſt doom. <hi>Many,</hi> that Biers are become reſtleſſe Peripateticks, the Spade and Mattock tyred, the Sextons ſtill dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, the Graves ſtill gaping, paſſing-Bells without any ſtop or period, confounding the language one of another, the Church-yards more peopled then the Theaters; <hi>Miſta ſenum, ac juvenum denſantur funera,</hi> no ſex, nor age, nor, young, nor old, are ſpared, but are made a ſubject for death to read mortalitie's le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture upon. This made <hi>David</hi> complain, that his <hi>bones waxed old, and that his moyſture was turned into the drought of ſummer, Pſal.</hi> 32. made him houle and cry, that his <hi>daies were conſumed like ſmoak, his bones were burned as hearth, withered like graſſe;</hi> he was <hi>become like a Pelican in the wilderneſſe, or a ſparrow on the houſe top, Pſ.</hi> 102. This made <hi>Job</hi> complain, that his <hi>griefe was heavier then the ſand of the ſea,</hi> that <hi>the arrowes of the Almighty were within him, that the poyſon had drunk up his ſpirit, the terrours of God had ſet themſelves in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray againſt him, Job</hi> 6. This makes all Mankinde rot as a Pomgranate, ſhiver as a Potſheard, ſplinter as a <hi>Venice</hi> Glaſſe, corrupt as a ſtanding Pool, and vaniſh into aſhes like <hi>Sodom</hi>'s Apples.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon of all this, is, becauſe the juſtice
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93936:74"/> of God requires it; ſin is daily in the view of his all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piercing eye, ſends up cries aloud into his holy ear, piercing through the clouds for revenge, importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his vindicative hand, to whet his glittering ſword, to feather his arrowes, to make ſharp the point of his ſpear, to waſh his footſteps in blood: And then ſhall not he, that hath called his footſtool the Earth, and his throne the Heavens to witneſſe, and hath ſworn by himſelfe the greateſt, that ſin ſhall not paſſe without revenge, ſhall not he be juſt? Beſides this, conſider all Creatures, as daily Oratours, that miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably complaining, put up their petitions to him. The higher Houſe the ſuburbs of Heaven, ſits droo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, the Sun is turned into blood, and eclipſed, the Stars unſnuffed burn dim within the ſocket of their ſphears, their naturall force abated, their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence impaired, all waxes old as does a garment, and ſaies, that ſin is the cauſe. The aire is ſtifled with the poyſoned breath of meteors, and inſteed of comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the inhabitants of the earth, is become a ſtage of prodigies and terrours, flying Dragons amaze, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Stars as Beacons of aſtoniſhment affright, Thunder with her loud Canon-ſhot makes roaring, the impetuous fury of the Bolts brings death; the Clouds, in time of need are barren, in time of harveſt intoxicate the earth with deluges; no dew ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times but mildew, no light but lightning, no blaſt nor gale of winde but blaſting, and ſaies, that ſin is the cauſe. The ſea roules, the windes blow unmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the waves rage impetuouſly, all things are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled unnaturally, which makes the Leviathans roar, and the fiſhes die, and ſaies, that ſin is the cauſe. The earth quakes and trembles like a recoyling Cano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93936:75"/> weep, the flowers droop, and cloſes up their heads within the lap of their mother earth; the graſſe wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the corn is blaſted, the fruits are thunderſtroke, and in ſtead of pagles, daizes, and roſes of paradiſe, bryars, brambles, nettles, thiſtles, ſpring out of her wombe, and ſaies, that ſin is the cauſe. All Nations, all States, all Kingdomes, are troubled, and ſaies, that ſin is the cauſe. The Pagans againſt Turks, Turks againſt Chriſtendom, one Province againſt another, as whirlewindes in a ſtrait, move tumults. Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Sweden</hi> hath long ſit in Sable, as a Matron mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning under the Myrtle trees, deploring the diſmall fate of her deceaſed Worthy, which occaſion'd ſo many alterations in government ſince, and fluctuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in State, and ſaies, that ſin is the cauſe. <hi>Poland</hi> lies ſick, licking the ſcars of her lately received wounds, and ſaies, that ſin is the cauſe. <hi>Denmark</hi> bewailes her ill <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Whole <hi>Italy</hi> is diſtracted with convulſions, and the State of <hi>Venice</hi> can ſcarce finde a pillow to ſleep ſecurely upon, and ſaies, that ſin is the cauſe. <hi>France,</hi> before ſhe could recover her blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed at the great Maſſacre, hath begun to bleed afreſh with civill jarrs, and ſaies, that ſin is the cauſe. Whole <hi>Germany</hi> hath been for many years in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion, burning of Cities is no greater wonder, then the ſparkling of a Smith's forge; ſlaying of men of as ſmall account, as of ſheep in a ſlaughter-houſe; to die in Troops as familiar, as to live in Trenches; ſuch overflowing of blood, that Rivers were dyed with the crimſon tincture; old grey heads mourning, yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93936:75"/> their children, and cannot be comforted, becauſe they are not; and all conclude, that ſin is the cauſe. We of theſe Nations, once ſtyled fortunate Ilands, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded like <hi>Goſhen</hi> in the midſt of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> with turelar Angells, have for theſe many years layne under the ſtroke of the deſtroying Angell, and the ſtage of War hath been ſet up in our Territories, making all places <hi>Aceldama</hi>'s, fields of blood, the Common-weal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted with factions, the Church rent with ſchiſms; and, as if theſe inteſtine broyles at home were not ſufficient, engagements with the <hi>Hollanders</hi> abroad, to the loſſe of life and treaſury; with whom, no ſooner was a Peace (if laſting) made, but <hi>Spain,</hi> that had fed us with her blandiſhments, proclaimes her ſelfe an enemy, preparing hoſtility againſt us, as if the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mado</hi> in <hi>eighty eight,</hi> were but an earneſt of what they intended to pay us. Thus this poor Church and State lies bleeding, and is not ſin the cauſe? Well then, to ſum up all, ſhall not the petitions of the Heavens darkned, of the Stars bedimn'd, of the Aire poyſoned, of the Sea troubled, of the Earth curſed, of Kingdomes ruinated, of the unreaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures groaning under the burden, and looking up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven, as if the Stars that fought in order for <hi>Siſera,</hi> would pitty and reſcue them; ſhall not theſe (I ſay) awake the Lord out of ſleep, as a Gyant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed with wine, to put on his Brigandine, and to gird on his Sword? If ſouls for this deſerve to die, then how much more the body? And ſhall not theſe that were petitioners, become alſo executioners? Lo the heavens, (as if it were their task to kill and ſlay) hath for her armes hung up in the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> man's ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy; the Planet <hi>Mars,</hi> as though he were ſtill the god of War, the <hi>Dog-ſtar</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> murders their
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93936:76"/> children; the Ayer poyſons with infections, feavours, plagues; the Sea is become a devouring gulph, and, contrary to Nature's intent, is made a <hi>Goigotha</hi> or place of ſculls; the Earth, that with her fruites ſhould have nouriſhed, and with her conſerves cheriſhed, is become an <hi>Aceldama,</hi> or Theatre of blood; one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one City, one Kingdome, one Family, one Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther riſes up againſt another, as if man were born with thoſe, that aroſe of the Dragon's teeth in the Poet, <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis peri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e gladiis,</hi> bleed to death on one anothers ſword. And then ſhall not Gods juſt wrath, our juſt deſert, ſo many executioners in heaven, in earth, by ſea, by land, bring ruine and calamity of Church and State, Cities and Families?</p>
                  <p>Hence (as the caſe ſtands) we are blame-worthy in a four-fold reſpect: 1. Of Satan. 2. Of ſecurity. 3. Of pride. 4. Of intemperance. Firſt, of Satan, who by his ſubtle ſleights, as he hath killed the body, would mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der alſo the ſoul; and yet we ſleight it, as though we ſhould die neither body nor ſoul. Satan is that Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that with his ſweet odours allures us, till he have gotten us within the reach of his talants, that he may tear us; that Crocodile, that commiſerates us, till he have murdered us; that Hyena, that flatters us, till he have killed us; that Syren, that ſings till ſhe hath drowned us; that, with <hi>Jael,</hi> allures in with milk, and murders with a nail; with <hi>Joab,</hi> embraces with one hand, and ſtabs with another; that whore of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> that gives poyſoned drink in golden cups; that cunning fiſher, that baits his hooks with the pleaſures of ſin; that lies as a Snake in thy greeneſt graſſe, as an Enemy to aſſault thee in thy ſecureſt travails, as a Ruffian to cut thy throat in thy ſweereſt ſleep. Art thou banquetting like <hi>Job</hi>'s children with thy friends?
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93936:76"/> take heed, Satan's there. Art thou with <hi>Job</hi> praying? take heed, Satan's there. Art thou with <hi>Iudas</hi> and the Apoſtles receiving the Communion? take heed, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's there. In thy eating, in thy drinking, in thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, in thy praying, in thy meditating, beware, Satan is buſie about thee; take heed, he that hath wrought thy bodily death, would alſo of thy ſoul. O man of God beware, <hi>mors in ollâ,</hi> death is in the pot.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this diſcovers the ſecurity of carnall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure men, that mind death no more hanging over their heads, then <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> did the blazing Star, and Army in the aire; then <hi>Damocles</hi> did the glittering ſword, perpendicular over his head; then <hi>Ionah</hi> did the ſwelling of the waves over the Ship, while he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hatches ſleeping: but they lie ſnorting in a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy of ſin, till a deluge of death overwhelme them, as the flood did the old World, as fire and brimſtone did <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> as the houſe of <hi>Dagon</hi> did the Philiſtims; that then death, and grave, and worms, and hell, and deſtruction, ſeazes upon them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this diſcovers the vanity of pride; many while their life is conſuming, as a candle burning within the ſocket, as a coal taken out of the fire grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing black, ſtudies only to varniſh and paint over that rotten ſtock the body, robbing all creatures to adorn it, from one takes his wool, from another his skin, from another his fur, from another their excrements, as ſilk from worms; beggs pearles of the fiſhes, diggs into the ground for gold and ſilver, turnes up the ſands of the ſea for pretious ſtones; and then, Peacock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, prides themſelves in theſe, which are but liveries of beaſts, ſcum of the earth, badges of ſin, earneſts of death, and recogniſants of hell; thus jetting, till death comes, and ſounds his trumpet in his ear, <hi>O fool, this</hi>

                  <p>Fourthly, this diſcovers the vanity of intemperate and voluptuous men, that with <hi>Philoxenus,</hi> ſtudie only to reliſh dainties, make their throats tunnells, and their bellies barrells, and ſhewes by their daily ſacrifices, their <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Conſider again, this was more particularly for the ſins of <hi>Eli</hi> and his Sons: Let thoſe that attend upon God's Ordinances in this preſent age, reflectupon this. It muſt be acknowledg'd ſure, that the hand of God hath gone out againſt us, more then againſt others of our rank at other times; at leaſt, that God hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained violence againſt us, ſo as he did againſt thoſe of our profeſſion in the daies of old. The portion of the Egyptian Prieſt (that ſerved the Ox, the Ape, and the Onyon) eſcaped ſale in the time of the famine.

Thus then did God reſtrain the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93936:77"/> ſpirit of Princes; yet, that God, who in his own Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 22. gave the Levites a ſpeciall priviledge of redeeming lands ſold by themſelves at any time, when other tribes were limited to a ſet time, hath not ſtayed the raging of theſe waves, but that the Churches Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony is ſold to others without redemption. We muſt acknowledge, that God's wrath (whether for our perſonall ſins, or the ſins of our Predeceſſors, or for the ſins of the people joyntly) hath taken hold of us, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. 5. that <hi>the Lord hath deviſed a device againſt us, hath watched upon the evill, and hath brought it upon us. For under the whole heaven hath not been done, as hath been done unto Ieruſalem, Dan.</hi> 9. 14. Let us not flatter our ſelves preſumptuouſly; the puniſhment anſwers the ſin, as the wax the ſeal, and as the moulds own the figure, and let us own both.</p>
                  <p>Yet, let none think now, that this confeſſion will give advantage to the adverſary, they may take where none is given: They may ſay, let the Lord be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by their own confeſſion, <hi>we offend not,</hi> though we devoure and diſhonour them, <hi>becauſe they have ſinned againſt the Lord, the habitation of juſtice, Ier.</hi> 50. 7. But they ſhall finde at laſt, that to forſake the Levite is a ſin, that it is a bitter thing to help forward affliction, when God is but a little diſpleaſed, that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> will be a cup of trembling, and a burdenſome ſtone to every one that cries, but down with it. <hi>Wo to thee O Aſhur, the rod of Gods wrath, the ſtaſſe in thine hand is Gods indignation for our correction;</hi> to purifie us the ſons of <hi>Levi</hi> from our droſſe: For, <hi>It is the Lord that does it.</hi> So we paſſe from the Revelation, to the Acceptation, <hi>And he ſaid, it is the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how did <hi>Eli</hi> know that it was the Lord? Partly by the man of God, partly by <hi>Samuel</hi>'s dream or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

                  <p>So we paſſe from his confeſſion, to his ſubmiſſion, <hi>Let him do what ſeemeth him good. Peter Martyr</hi> makes a ſcruple, whether theſe words proceeded from a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſoul or no, ſaying, they might come from an

                  <p>But why does not <hi>Eli</hi> labour to reverſe this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

This was <hi>Ely</hi>'s choice, let him do what ſeemeth him good. And motives to patient ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to what God ſhall lay upon us, may be theſe. Firſt, meditate, that our ſins deſerves ſcorpions, and we are but chaſtiſed with rods; an eternall curſe, is turned to a momentary ſhort correction: and ſhall we
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93936:80"/> murmur at reſtraint for a day, who have demerited everlaſting impriſonment? Secondly, we are in the hands of a loving Father, who corrects us for our good; it's a file to eat off our ruſt, a fire to purge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our droſſe, a corroſive to corrode our dead fleſh: We patiently ſubmit to earthly Fathers, and ſhall not we much more to our heavenly Father, in hope of an eternall Crown? Thirdly, Chriſt was <hi>vir dolorum,</hi> a man of ſorrowes, undergoing his Father's heavy diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for us: Shall not we then take up the Croſſe, and follow him, ſeeing it is his pleaſure, that we muſt go through this Wilderneſſe, and tread on fiery Serpents, before we come at <hi>Canaan?</hi> Chriſt ſuffered for us, leaving us an example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. which St. <hi>Paul</hi> preſſes, <hi>Heb. 12. 1, 2. Let us run with patience the race that is ſet before us, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king unto Jeſus, the Author and finiſher of our faith, who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the croſſe, and deſpiſed the ſhame.</hi> Fourthly, theſe ſharp humours have run in all the veines of the myſticall body of Chriſt hitherto: no afflictions befall us, but ſuch as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in our brethren that are in the world. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was in priſon, <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lion's den, the three Children in the fiery furnace, <hi>Job</hi> on the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, <hi>Lazarus</hi> proſtrate at the rich Man's gates, the bleſſed Virgin's heart was pierced with a ſword, the Apoſtles in the gaole. And we have a promiſe, that the God of all grace, after we have ſuffered a while; will make us perfect, ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen, and ſettle us: And that God of his fidelity, will not ſuffer us to be tempted above that we are able, but will with the temptation alſo, make a way to eſcape, that we may be able to bear it.

For it is the habitation of God, of Chriſt, of the holy Ghoſt; as great a difference as there is betwixt a Snailes houſe and a Palace, a Tortoiſe ſhell, and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Gourd, and the Towers of <hi>Ninivey,</hi> ſo much, and more difference, is betwixt heaven, and any thing that can be upon earth. We ſee this is the compoſure of the World, that fineſt things are ſcituated in the higheſt places; the earth, as groſſeſt, is put in the loweſt room, the Water above the Earth, the Aire above the Water; the Fire above the Aire, the Sphears of Heaven, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then any of them, above the reſt, which you ſee beautified with Sun, Moon, and Stars, ſhining more gloriouſly, then all the pretious Stones in the world; and all this, but the neather ſide of the pavement of that Palace; then what ſhall be the glory of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Heavens within, able to drink up all afflictions, as the Sea does the River <hi>Iordan.</hi> There are three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct places, in which every Saint ſucceſſively, is reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; firſt, in his mother's wombe; ſecondly, in the world; thirdly, in heaven. As much as the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe is larger then our mothers wombe, ſo much is
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93936:82"/> heaven larger and ampler than it; for, if one ſtar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the earth ſo much in bigneſſe, then what ſhall the heavens, that contain infinite ſtars? Secondly, as in largeneſſe, ſo in time; our time to be in our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombs is but nine months, but on earth it may be an hundred times nine months; but our beeing in heaven is without period of daies, months, or years. Thirdly, as no man can remember, what ſorrow he had in his mothers wombe, ſo ſhall our joies in heaven drink up all our ſufferings upon earth. And this glory conſiſts, either eſſentially, in the beatificall viſion, or operatively, in the effects it works in us. Eſſentially, in the beatifical viſion, (though the <hi>Familiſts</hi> and <hi>Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi> underſtand it not, confounding grace and glory) but no man upon earth hath ſeen God, neither can he be ſeen, that is, perfectly; it is true, we may ſee God here in a naturall viſion in his Creatures, as in a Glaſſe, wherein ſome ſplendour of his glory ſhines; he may be ſeen in a ſpecular or ſymbolicall viſion, by ſignes and characters of his glory; ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to have ſeen Gods hinder parts, <hi>Eſa. 6. 1. I ſaw the Lord ſitting upon his throne, high, and lifted up, his houſe was full of maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

But the beatificall viſion in heaven, is to behold God and Chriſt Jeſus face to face, we ſhall ſee him as he is, no veiles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put betwixt us. Stay here, and pauſe a while. What comfort will this be, to ſee the Lamb ſit upon his ſeat of ſtate? If the wiſe men of the Eaſt came ſo far, and rejoyced to ſee him in the manger, what will it be to ſee him ſitting in his glory? If St. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> did leap at his preſence in his mothers wombe, what
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93936:82"/> ſhall this his preſence do, in his royall and eternall Kingdome? If the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> was aſtoniſhed at the ſight of <hi>Solomon,</hi> what ſhall we be at the ſight of millions of Saints in his Court, every one greater than <hi>Solomon,</hi> throwing down their Crowns before him the King of Kings? To this, joyne the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints; imagine what a comfort will it be, to meet with the noble Army of Martyrs, the goodly fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Prophets, the holy ſociety of all the Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Confeſſors, where we ſhall ſee their Crowns of glory ſet upon their heads, which Chriſt confers upon them, not for their merits, but for his mercies ſake.</p>
                  <p>The effects the beatificall viſion works on us, are radiant either in ſoul or body; in ſoul, where firſt the underſtanding ſhall be truly enlightned with divine and heavenly knowledge, which God ſhall immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reveal unto us, without the miniſtry of men and Angells. Secondly, in our Will, which ſhall be filled with righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, perfect love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, charity towards our fellow Saints for ever. Thirdly, in our Affections, which ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed without at axie or diſorder, into eternall harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as <hi>Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The effects it works on the body conſiſts in theſe particulars: Firſt, of mortall bodies, they ſhall be made immortall; of corruptible, incorruptible; our fleſh, that is ſubject to ſo many mutations, vexed with ſo many diſeaſes, defiled with ſo many corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, peſtered with ſo many infinite calamities, ſhall
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93936:83"/> be made moſt glorious, and moſt perfect, to endure for ever without change, and to raigne with the ſoul world without end. Secondly, of a naturall, it ſhall become a ſpirituall body, not in eſſence and being, but in quality and condition, becauſe it ſhall be freed from all paines and troubles that belongs to the ſame, as ſin, eating, drinking, ſleeping, and the like. Thirdly, of a weak, it ſhall become a powerfull body, by reaſon of agility and nimbleneſſe, able to mount towards Heaven, and meet our Saviour in the Aire. Fourthly, of a deformed and imperfect, it ſhall be a perfect and beautifull body; <hi>Iacob</hi> ſhall not halt, <hi>Leab</hi> ſhall not be blear-eyed, nor <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> lame, but all ſhall be as nimble as Harts.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe free times, wherein every one takes liberty to expoſe his thoughts to the world, give me leave alſo to offer up my Mite into the publick Treaſury, which ſhall conſiſt but of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold conſideration; firſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſhonouring of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; ſecondly, whether robbing of God in Tithes and offerings, and defeating of Chriſt's Embaſſadours of a comperent livelyhood, may not portend miſery, and calamity, if not ruine, to a Church or State?</p>
                  <p>For the former, when God gives up a people to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour their Miniſters, it argues, Religion is decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: They are his Souldiers, Stewards, Angells; He is their Portion, He hath promiſed to be with them to the end of the world, that the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt them; that he will recompence a cup of cold water that is given them; he that heareth them
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93936:84"/> heareth Him, he that deſpiſeth them deſpiſeth Him. When the Prophet would diſcover the Jewes to be ready to be ſwallowed up in the whirle-pool of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, he gives them this character, that they are like a <hi>people that conteſt with their prieſt. Corah</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> murmured againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the earth ſwallowed them up, with all their partakers.</p>
                  <p>For the latter, (which here I principally intend) the danger of robbing of God in Tithes and Offerings, and defeating Chriſts Spouſe of her joynture, let three things be ſeriouſly weighed: Firſt, whether the tenth part of the fruits of the earth are not as due to God, as the ſeventh part of our time, and ſo the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie thereof founded upon the ſame bottom, that our Chriſtian Sabbath is. Secondly, if not ſo, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is not an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, morall equity, if the Prieſthood under the Law received the tenth part and more, the Miniſtry under the Goſpell, which is more honourable and laborious, ſhould not receive at leaſt as much, and whether that be not the principall ſcope of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. which he makes good by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall arguments. Thirdly, if neither of theſe Rocks ſhould prove impregnable, whether this be not a wall of braſſe, able to endure what ſiege Antichriſtian forces can lay againſt it, that being once conſecrated, and by ſpeciall donation appropriated unto God, a Power leſſe then Divine, can not reduce them to any other uſe, without ſacriledge, and taking the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of Gods hand: And whether that ſignall judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicted on <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphyra, Act.</hi> 5. for retaining that which they had devoted unto God, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their private vowes, be not a miraculous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this truth, and a piller of ſalt to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon to the worlds end? <hi>Iſrael is a thing hallowed</hi>

                     <hi>to the Lord, and his firſt fruits; all they that eat it ſhalloffend, evill ſhall come upon them, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 2. 3. Tithes are Gods portion, whereby we acknowledge His roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and ſuperintendency over us, and therefore being once ſolemnly bequeath'd unto him, may ſeem to be inviolable by any juſt Law of man, for theſe reaſons: Firſt, <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in him <hi>Levi,</hi> payed Tithes to <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedeck,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, even of the ſpoiles taken in war, <hi>Gen. 14. 20. Heb.</hi> 7. 4. and that above four hundred years before the Law was given. Secondly, <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> vowed as he went to <hi>Padan Aram,</hi> that if God would bleſſe him, the Lord ſhould be his God, and that ſurely he would give the tenth unto him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 22. Now that the Lord ſhould be acknowledged for his God, was a morall duty, and no leſſe the other for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, eſpecially after his vow, and reducible to the duties of the firſt Table. Thirdly, God ſtrictly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to pay the tithes of all things to the Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites; nay, the firſt fruits, firſt and ſecond tithes, heave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings, wave-offerings, which amounted to nineteen in the hundred, or above the ſixt part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>; which Precept, if it be not purely morall, but judiciall in ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, reſpecting equity betwixt Prieſt and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yet it holds proportion to the Miniſtry of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, according to their dignity and neceſſity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing devoted unto God by our fore-fathers, famous in their Generations for piety, are as obligatory, as what God himſelfe immediately conſecrated. Fourthly, God calls it a robbing of him in tithes and offerings, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 8. and for that, pronounces the whole Nation cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a curſe, that is, a ſignall curſe, which the Spirit of God does not uſe to do for violating Lawes, that are purely judiciall or ceremoniall. Fifthly, Chriſt confirms them under the Goſpell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 23. tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Phariſees, they <hi>pay tithes of Anniſe, Mint, and</hi>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:93936:85"/> 
                     <hi>Cummin, theſe things ought to be done.</hi> And if they could not enter into heaven, unleſſe their righteouſneſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſees, what ſhall become of thoſe, that come ſhort of them? The Phariſees payed cheerfully things hallowed unto God, Chriſtians do not. Sixtly, the Apoſtle of the Gentiles makes ſacriledge (which conſiſts in detaining of tithes and holy things) worſe than Idolatry, <hi>Rom. 2. 32. Thou that abhorreſt Idolls, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, doſt thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſacri'edge?</hi> To rob God of his due is a greater ſin, then, through miſtake, to aſcribe that to a falſe God, which is not his due. Seventhly, it ſeemes by the Law of Nature, or a Poſitive Law of God, to be derived from <hi>Noah</hi> to all Nations; <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaies in <hi>Camillus,</hi> that they did <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, pay tithes to <hi>Jupiter. Herodotus</hi> ſaies, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that they offered unto <hi>Hercules</hi> the tenth part of their wealth; ſo did the Hetrurians, calling it the <hi>Herculian part,</hi> as <hi>Plautus</hi> hath it in his <hi>Truculentus. Xenophon</hi> ſaies, the Grecians did offer their tithes at the Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos. Ariſtotle, lib. 2. Oeconomicks,</hi> ſaies, that the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians payed tithes. Hence it was, that Princes, (when they came like <hi>Caligula,</hi> to challenge Deity to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) uſurped the tithes. <hi>Appian</hi> records, that the Sicilians and other conquered Nations, payed the tenth part to the Roman Emperours; therefore the Publicans (as <hi>Cicero</hi> hath it) are called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, tithe-gatherers. Eighthly, that tithes ſhould be payed, was the judgment of the Antients, that lived in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times; St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaies, that <hi>Abraham</hi> in paying of tithes was our Inſtructor, teaching us what we ſhould do; St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſaies, <hi>Quod qui non fecerit, deum defrandare, &amp; ſupplantare convincitur,</hi> that he that paies not tithes, defraudes and undermines God.

                     <hi>autem totum tollitur,</hi> We have been unwilling to pay God his tithes, therefore it is juſt he ſhould take all from us. Ninthly, many Councills have confirmed the paying of tithes; the firſt, <hi>Aurelian, chap.</hi> 17. the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>Matiſcone, chap.</hi> 5. the <hi>Forojulium,</hi> in the laſt Chapter; at <hi>Ments,</hi> in the time of <hi>Charls</hi> the Great, <hi>chap.</hi> 38. at <hi>Mentz</hi> under <hi>Rabanus, chap.</hi> 10. at <hi>Mentz,</hi> in the time of the Emperour <hi>Arnulph, chap.</hi> 17. where it was decreed, that thoſe that neglected to pay tithes, ſhould be excommunicated.

Tenthly, the Heathens, by the glimmering light of reaſon, puniſhed thoſe that were ſacrilegious: <hi>Plato</hi> ordained in his Lawes, that if a ſervant or ſtranger ſhould detain holy things, they ſhould be branded in the hands and forehead; but if a free-man, he ſhould be put to death. This was one of the twelve Tables of the ancient Romans, <hi>Sacrum, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crove commodatum qui rapſit, parricida eſto,</hi> Let him that ſteales any holy thing, or dedicated to a holy uſe, be puniſhed as a parricide; that is, as one that murders his father or mother, and that was, to be ſowen in a ſack of Leather, with a Serpent in it, and throwne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea. Amongſt the Aethiopians, if any was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of that crime, a potion was given him to drink of divers kinds of poyſon, which was no ſooner taken, but it ſo wrought upon the fancy, that they conceived themſelves to be ſtung with all kindes of Serpents, and to be rid of that pain, they made away themſelves. Eleventhly, Hiſtories tells us, that imbezilling or ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enating of tithes, hath been the Prodrome and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger of ruine to ſeverall Nations, Churches, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies: In <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s raigne, tithes began to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:93936:86"/> that he appointed Overſeers to look to the payment thereof, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31. 11. for which cauſe, God ſuſpended the judgment for his time; but his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours growing careleſſe, they were given up to a Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh captivity, and their temple deſtroyed. About one hundred and thirty years before our Saviour's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, corruption ſo prevailed, that it began to be queſtionable, whether tithes were to be payed or no, whence their high Court of <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> decreed, that inſtead of the tenth (as <hi>Moſes Cotſenſis</hi> hath it) they ſhould pay one part of an hundred; and ſhortly after, God took from them their Rulers, their Temple, their Land, and all. O what a ſad thing is it, when men will be wiſer than God. It was one of <hi>Julian</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtata's projects, to ſupplant Chriſtianity, by taking away the livelyhood of the Miniſtry. The Eaſtern and African Churches acted their parts in this Scene, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were delivered up to the dolefull Cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe of Mahometan blindneſſe and ſlavery. What ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth had in pillaging of the Church, the dyſaſters in his Family, and the ſad tragedies of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Wolſey,</hi> the Vicar-generall, with the reſt of his Agents, and many of thoſe Tribes that were enriched by them, can ſignally witneſſe. Laſtly, Sacriledge hath been inevitably attended with remarkable judgments in all ages: <hi>Xerxes</hi> and <hi>Brennus</hi> ſent their Souldiers to violate the Temple at <hi>Delphos,</hi> the one was deſtroyed with all his Army, by lightning; the other loſt forty thouſand of his Foot by fire from heaven: The Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that <hi>Cambyſes</hi> ſent to ſpoyl the Temple of <hi>Ammon,</hi> were buried quick under heaps of ſands, and he ſlain with his own ſword. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> having pillaged the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſian <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> was wracked with his whole Navy, and left to the mercy of the waves: <hi>Alſimus,</hi> high Prieſt of the Jewes, attempting the overthrow of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93936:86"/> was ſtruck with a dead Palſie, and dyed miſerably. <hi>Heliodorus</hi> ſent by <hi>Seleucus,</hi> to ranſack the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> felt the revenging hand of God, till <hi>Onias</hi> the high Prieſt interceded for him; out of which Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when <hi>Craſſus</hi> the Roman Generall had taken two thouſand talents of gold, he was no ſooner paſſed over the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> then his whole Army was rooted by the Parthians, and part of the gold he had taken, melted, and poured into his mouth, with theſe words, <hi>Now ſurfeit on gold after thy death, which thou couldſt not be ſatisfied with, all thy life long.

Theſe Items laid together, makes up this totall Sum.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt expedient, that marriage of Church-members be ſolemnized by thoſe, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>3</label> who are Chriſt's Embaſſadours, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties in his Propheticall Office, and are beſt qualified and authoriſed, to inſtruct the parties, concerning the inſtitution, uſe, and ends thereof, and confer a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction upon them.

                  <p>Secondly, the tripartite uſe and end of marriage (as filed by the Schoolmen) pleads for the ſame, which is, iſſue, fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, <note place="margin">Targum Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſol.</note> and the ſacred myſtery thereof: The key of Iſſue is Gods ſpeciall peculiar, <hi>God remembered Rachel, and opened her womb, Gen.</hi> 30. 22. Numerous iſſue is his peculiar, with a more ſignall benediction, <hi>Thy wife ſhall be as a fruitfull vine by the ſides of thine houſe, thy children like olive-plants round about thy table.

                  <p>That, whoſe end and uſe is Gods ſole pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and his ſignall and tranſcendent <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Another end and uſe of marriage, is fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which includes unanimity, chaſtity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy. Yoke-fellowes in wedlock ought to be Turtle-like, unanimous in all eſtates; <note place="margin">
